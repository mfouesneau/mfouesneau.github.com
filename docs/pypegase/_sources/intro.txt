Introduction
------------

The growing body of high quality photometric surveys of clusters and especially
the increasing techniques and instrument sensitivity offer a very new study
window for low and intermediate mass objects. It makes necessary to push the
confidence level of our model to this kind of objects to produce reliable
interpretations of their colors and luminosities. To derive intrinsic properties
of unresolved stellar populations, one can either fit an integrated observed
spectrum with a synthetic spectral energy distribution (SED) or adjust synthetic
SEDs with the integrated photometry, which remains the path of choice for
studying large samples.  Luminosities and colors of stellar populations are
related to their ages, masses and metallicities, in a very complex relation.
Various models (e.g., 
`Fioc & Rocca-Volmerange 1997 <http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9707017v1>`_, 
`Leitherer et al. 1999 <http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1999ApJS..123....3L>`_,
`Vazdekis & Arimoto 1999 <http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1999ApJ...525..144V>`_, 
`Bruzual & Charlot 2003 <http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2003MNRAS.344.1000B>`_, 
`Cordier et al. 2007 <http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2007AJ....133..468C>`_
) allow us
to predict the evolution of their SEDs. They are based on assumptions for the
stellar evolution (evolutionary tracks), and for formation history (initial mass
function, star formation rate...). 

Simple stellar population (SSP) synthesis is the atomic component of any SED
prediction. Conceptually, all stars of an SSP are co-eval, at any given time,
the stars composing an SSP describe the same isochrone.  A priori, we cannot
tell all stellar groups, associations or star clusters are SSPs Regardless some
clusters have been shown explicitly to host stellar populations of a composite
nature (e.g.  NGC 2808, 
`Piotto et al.  2007 <http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2007ApJ...661L..53P>`_; see also 
`Kalirai & Richer 2010 <http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010RSPTA.368..755K>`_;
`van Loon 2010 <http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010RSPTA.368..801V>`_, 
or :math:`\omega`-Centauri, 
`Villanova et al.  2007 <http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2007ApJ...663..296V>`_
), star clusters are
often quoted as the reference in matter of SSP examples in nature. 

One major issue when studying low and intermediate mass clusters is the
fluctuations due to the random presence of a very few luminous stars dominating
the energy distribution. Pioneering work has shown that the predicted luminosity
and color distributions depend strongly on the total mass in the cluster, and
can be far from Gaussian even for total mass above :math:`10^5M_\odot`
(e.g., 
`Lancon & Mouhcine 2000 <http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2000ASPC..211...34L>`_,
`Bruzual 2002 <http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2002IAUS..207..616B>`_, 
`Cervino & Luridiana 2006 <http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2006A%26A...451..475C>`_
). A reliable interpretation
of observed SEDs requires models able to predict these fluctuations. Because it
remains on accounting for the presence of massive stars in a given population,
this translate into considering the IMF to be discrete.  To address the question
of producing {\em Discrete population synthesis models}, we adapted the last
version of `PEGASE.2 (Fioc & Rocca-Volmerange 1999) <http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1999astro.ph.12179F>`_ to explicitly produce SEDs of discrete
populations. 

We develop a code, and focuses on its predicted colors and luminosities
according to different assumptions.

Simple stellar population (SSP)
-------------------------------

Stellar Population Synthesis (SPS) models are tools to help the interpretation
of the integrated light (or colors, line indices, ...) that we observe from
the galaxies. These tools follow a common recipes to predict the observations.
Ideally, we want to determine what mix of stars and stellar physics give rise to
the observations. The general problem is very broad and needs to account for
stellar evolution, but also dynamical evolution of populations, while including
also interactions with the interstellar medium (mass-loss, enrichment,
ionization, galactic winds...).  


A common recipe
```````````````

As a simplification, the common assumption is to consider a composite of
multiple co-eval populations: single-age single-metallicity, so-called
"simple" or "single" populations. 
In one "Single Stellar Population" (SSP), :math:`N` stars are formed at the same
time :math:`t`, with a mass distribution distribution driven by the chosen initial
mass function (IMF), :math:`\phi(m)`, and with identical chemical composition :math:`Z`. The
integrated spectrum of such population is given by: the summation of the spectrum
:math:`f_\lambda` of the individual stars drawn from a given mass function,

.. math::

        \begin{eqnarray}
          S_\lambda^N (t, Z) &=& \sum_{i=1}^{N} f_\lambda\, \left( m_i, t, Z \right)\, \\
          \&~ {dN}/{dm} &=& \phi(m),
          \label{eq:ssp}
        \end{eqnarray}

where the mass function, :math:`\phi(m)`, represents the probability of a mass :math:`m` to
contribute to the observed light of the population.

The true difficulty lies into the determination of the individual star
distribution of energy of mass, :math:`M`, age, :math:`t`, and metallicity,
:math:`Z`. Strictly, :math:`f_\lambda` is a complex function of stellar
evolution physics and the mapping with time and chemical composition is not
trivial. This first requires stellar evolutionary tracks or isochrone, which
determine where a star of given stellar parameters (:math:`M,\,t,\,Z`) lies on
the Hertzsprung-Russel (HR) diagram or :math:`\log(g) - T_{eff}` diagram.
Second, it requires a spectral library, either from computation or empirical
construction, with full coverage of :math:`\log(g)`, :math:`T_{eff}`, and
:math:`Z` to predict what the resulting spectrum of such a star.  In practice,
for a given parameter triplet (:math:`M,\,t,\,Z`), :math:`f_\lambda` is computed
through (at least two) interpolations between isochrones and between reference
stars in the spectral library of choice.

Although the above equation summaries how to generate a spectrum of one SSP, it
is also clear that the computation cost include a direct relation with the
number :math:`N` of stars in the simulated population. 


The continuous assumption
`````````````````````````

A common simplification in SSP models is to consider a continuum of stars
instead of a discrete and finite number of them. In this context, each stellar
mass bin will contribute to the integrated SED according to the mass function:

.. math::

        \begin{eqnarray}
          S^\infty_\lambda (t, Z) &=& \int f_\lambda\, \left( m, t, Z \right)\, \phi(m) dm, 
        \end{eqnarray}

Note that :math:`S^\infty_\lambda (t, Z)` is normalized to :math:`1M_\odot` from
the inclusion of the mass function. Hence the total mass of the population
becomes a scaling factor.

In practice, the computation this equation requires a discretization
of the mass dimension in order to proceed to the integration.  However, the
timescales of the different evolution phases varies over many orders of
magnitudes.  As a result, a simple discretization leads to oscillations of the
emitted light (
`Charlot & Bruzual 1991 <http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1991ApJ...367..126C>`_
) unless rapid evolution phases can be
resolved with a sufficient time resolution (
`Lancon & Rocca-Volmerange 1996 <http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1996NewA....1..215L>`_
). To avoid that problem, one possibility is to discretize the mass
dimension according to the evolution phases variations. In other words the
isochrone is sampled such that every evolution phase is represented at least by
one mass bin. It follows:

.. math::
        \begin{eqnarray}
          S^\infty_\lambda (t, Z) &=& \sum_{i=1}^{N} f_\lambda\, \left( m_i, t, Z \right)\, \int_{m_{i}^{-}}^{m_{i}^{+}} \phi(m) dm,\\
          N &=& N(t,\,Z)
          \label{eq:conti_ssp}
        \end{eqnarray}

where :math:`[{m_{i}^{-}}, {m_{i}^{+}}]` is the mass range representative of the
evolution phase :math:`i, M` the total mass of the population, and the number :math:`N` of
masses implicitly becomes a function of time and metallicity: :math:`N(t,\,Z)`.

It could be surprising at first glance, that the above equation provides a
significant reduction of computing cost. However, by assuming a continuum of
stars, the number of synthetic stars :math:`N(t,\,Z)` is fixed whatever the
total mass of the simulated cluster. Hence, it becomes very handy for clusters
of a few :math:`10^4` stars. In practice, :math:`N` can be generally kept under
a few 1000 masses to conservatively sample any isochrone.

Limitation of the continuous assumption
```````````````````````````````````````
Although the continuous approximation strength is to simplify the computations,
its weakness is to forget about the discreteness of stellar populations.  

Pseudo-discrete assumption
``````````````````````````
We propose another approximation which aims at offering the speed of the
continuous assumption but at also including the discreteness of the population.
As in the original model (Eq.\,\ref{eq:ssp}), the integrated spectrum is made of
the summation of :math:`N` individual star spectrum :math:`\overline{f_{\lambda}}`,
with respect to an initial mass function:

.. math::

        \begin{eqnarray}
          S_\lambda^0 (t, Z) &=& \sum_{i=1}^{N} \overline{f_\lambda}\, \left( m_i, t, Z \right)\, \\
          {dN}/{dm} &=& \phi(m).
        \end{eqnarray}

However, we replace the individual SEDs, :math:`f_\lambda`, by an approximation
:math:`\overline{f_\lambda}`, such that 

.. math::

  \forall m_i\, \in\, \left[\,{m_{j}^{-}},\, {m_{j}^{+}}\,\right],
  \overline{f_\lambda}\, \left( m_i, t, Z \right) = 
  f_\lambda\, \left( m_j, t, Z \right) 

where the :math:`m_j` are defined in a similar manner as in the continuous
assumption.  However, the mass of the cluster is not just a scaling factor nor
the prediction only an average in comparison to the continuous modeling.

In this context, the stochastic and discrete nature of the stellar mass function
is fully conserved.

Limitations of the pseudo-discrete modeling
````````````````````````````````````````````

As in the continuous assumption, the gain at very low number of stars is only
marginal or in favor of a fully discrete modeling (Eq.\,\ref{eq:ssp}). However
the gain is that this assumption remains valid even in a low-number of stars,
while the errors on the SED of each individual star remains limited to the
sampling criteria on the evolution phases. We discuss this sampling and we
compare the predictions of the pseudo-discrete with discrete modeling in
Section XX.

The code we present is a branch of PEGASE.2 and is designed to be flexible to
replacing ingredients of the SSP modeling by others. Among with already
available compilations of libraries (\eg, isochrones, spectral libraries, IMF),
one can use his own ingredients with relatively low effort of python coding.
Object oriented codes offers the users to only provide file reading routines to
change a library.


SSP ingredients available in PyPegase 
--------------------------------------
We provide with this code a compiled version of SSP ingredients:

* IMF functions: Kennicutt, Kroupa2001 Kroupa93, MillerScalo, Salpeter, Scalo86, Scalo98;
* Isochrones: Pegase.2 reconnected isochrones, interface to the online PADOVA/PARSEC models;

* Extinction laws: Calzetti et al, 2000, Cardelli et al, 1989, Fitzpatrick, 1999, Gordon et al., 2003, SMC bar, interface to mix models.

In addition, the code provides the three methods of generating SSP models as
described above: continuous, discrete, pseudo-discrete assumptions.

We also provide a suite to compute the photometry of spectra through a large
