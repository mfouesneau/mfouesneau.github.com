GaiaUnlimited aims at determining the Gaia survey selection function and providing corresponding data and tools. The GaiaUnlimited project was started at the 2019 Santa Barbara Gaia Sprint, hosted by the Kavli Institute for Theoretical Physics at the University of California, Santa Barbara.

This project kicked off on 2021-01-01 and you can expect the first results, data, and tools to appear in 2022. Selection functions developed independently for Gaia DR2 and EDR3 can be found on the Related Projects page.
