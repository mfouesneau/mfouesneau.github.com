        The map is centered on the Galactic Center, with longitudes increasing towards the left.

        Colour–magnitude diagrams for the Hyades, Pleiades, and Praesepe star
        clusters. In each panel we indicate cluster members (defined by
        [Gaia Collaboration 2018a](https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2018/08/aa32516-17/aa32516-17.html#R34))
        using filled circles coloured according to their
        extinction estimates (white symbols are members without published
        extinction estimates in Gaia DR2). The solid lines indicate the PARSEC
        isochrones with parameter values, marked in the figure, taken from the
        estimates for the clusters from [Castellani et al. (2002)](https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2018/08/aa32516-17/aa32516-17.html#R19)
        for the Hyades
        and Pleiades and from [Taylor (2006)](https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2018/08/aa32516-17/aa32516-17.html#R75) for Praesepe.

### Gaia Astrophysical Parameters

The second data release of ESA’s Gaia satellite, published April 2018, not only includes data that allows us to compute accurate distances for 1.33 billion stars. we have also used Gaia’s measurements to derive the physical properties of almost 80 million stars, making this the largest stellar census yet. At the same time, the analysis provides the most detailed three-dimensional map of dust in our home galaxy yet, which promises to put the analysis of celestial objects on a more solid footing than before. However, this dataset remains a teaser to the future Gaia data relases.
