- abstract: "White dwarfs (WDs) offer unrealized potential in solving two problems\
    \ in astrophysics: stellar age accuracy and precision. WD cooling ages can be\
    \ inferred from surface temperatures and radii, which can be constrained with\
    \ precision by high-quality photometry and parallaxes. Accurate and precise Gaia\
    \ parallaxes along with photometric surveys provide information to derive cooling\
    \ and total ages for vast numbers of WDs. Here we analyze 1372 WDs found in wide\
    \ binaries with main-sequence (MS) companions and report on the cooling and total\
    \ age precision attainable in these WD+MS systems. The total age of a WD can be\
    \ further constrained if its original metallicity is known because the MS lifetime\
    \ depends on metallicity at fixed mass, yet metallicity is unavailable via spectroscopy\
    \ of the WD. We show that incorporating spectroscopic metallicity constraints\
    \ from 38 wide binary MS companions substantially decreases internal uncertainties\
    \ in WD total ages compared to a uniform constraint. Averaged over the 38 stars\
    \ in our sample, the total (internal) age uncertainty improves from 21.04% to\
    \ 16.77% when incorporating the spectroscopic constraint. Higher mass WDs yield\
    \ better total age precision; for eight WDs with zero-age MS masses \u22652.0\
    \ M <SUB>\u2299</SUB>, the mean uncertainty in total ages improves from 8.61%\
    \ to 4.54% when incorporating spectroscopic metallicities. We find that it is\
    \ often possible to achieve 5% total age precision for WDs with progenitor masses\
    \ above 2.0 M <SUB>\u2299</SUB> if parallaxes with \u22641% precision and Pan-STARRS\
    \ g, r, and i photometry with \u22640.01 mag precision are available."

- abstract: "The C-19 stream is the most metal poor stellar system ever discovered,\
    \ with a mean metallicity $[Fe/H] = -3.38\\pm0.06$. Its low metallicity dispersion\
    \ ($\\sigma_{\\rm [Fe/H]}$ $&lt;$ 0.18 at the 95\\% confidence level) as well\
    \ as variations in sodium abundances strongly suggest a globular cluster origin.\
    \ In this work, we use VLT/UVES spectra of seven C-19 stars to derive more precise\
    \ velocity measurements for member stars, and to identify two new members with\
    \ radial velocities and metallicities consistent with the stream's properties.\
    \ One of these new member stars is located 30 $\xB0$ away from the previously\
    \ identified body of C-19, implying that the stream is significantly more extended\
    \ than previously known and that more members likely await discovery. In the main\
    \ part of C-19, we measure a radial velocity dispersion $\\sigma_v$ = 6.2$^{+2.0}_{-1.4}$\
    \ km s$^{-1}$ from nine members, and a stream width of 0.56$\xB0\\pm0.08\xB0$,\
    \ equivalent to $\\sim$158 pc at a heliocentric distance of 18 kpc. These confirm\
    \ that C-19 is comparatively hotter, dynamically, than other known globular cluster\
    \ streams and shares the properties of faint dwarf galaxy streams. On the other\
    \ hand, the variations in the Na abundances of the three newly observed bright\
    \ member stars, the variations in Mg and Al for two of them, and the normal Ba\
    \ abundance of the one star where it can be measured provide further evidence\
    \ for a globular cluster origin. The tension between the dynamical and chemical\
    \ properties of C-19 suggests that its progenitor experienced a complex birth\
    \ environment or disruption history."

- abstract: Interstellar dust affects many astronomical observations through absorption
    and reddening, yet this extinction is also a powerful tool for studying interstellar
    matter in galaxies. Three-dimensional (3D) reconstructions of dust extinction
    and density in the Milky Way have suffered from artefacts such as the fingers-of-god
    effect and negative densities, and have been limited by large computational costs.
    Here, we aim to overcome these issues with a novel algorithm that derives the
    3D extinction density of dust in the Milky Way using a latent variable Gaussian
    process in combination with variational inference. Our model maintains non-negative
    density and hence monotonically non-decreasing extinction along all lines-of-sight,
    while performing the inference within a reasonable computational time. Using extinctions
    for hundreds of thousands of stars computed from optical and near-infrared photometry,
    together with distances based on Gaia parallaxes, we employ our algorithm to infer
    the structure of the Orion, Taurus, Perseus, and Cygnus X star-forming regions.
    A number of features that are superimposed in 2D extinction maps are clearly deblended
    in 3D dust extinction density maps. For example, we find a large filament on the
    edge of Orion that may host a number of star clusters. We also identify a coherent
    structure that may link the Taurus and Perseus regions, and we show that Cygnus
    X is located at 1300-1500 pc, in line with very-long-baseline interferometry measurements.
    We compute dust masses of the regions and find these to be slightly higher than
    previous estimates, likely a consequence of our input data recovering the highest
    column densities more effectively. By comparing our predicted extinctions to Planck
    data, we find that known relationships between density and dust processing, where
    high-extinction lines-of-sight have the most processed grains, hold up in resolved
    observations when density is included, and that they exist at smaller scales than
    previously suggested. This can be used to study the changes in size or composition
    of dust as they are processed in molecular clouds. <P />The 3D maps are only available

- abstract: Stellar physical and dynamical properties are essential knowledge to understanding
    the structure, formation, and evolution of our Galaxy. We produced an all-sky
    uniformly derived catalog of stellar astrophysical parameters (APs; age, mass,
    temperature, bolometric luminosity, distance, dust extinction) to give insight
    into the physical properties of Milky-Way stars. Exploiting the power of multi-wavelength
    and multi-survey observations from Gaia DR2 parallaxes and integrated photometry
    along with 2MASS and AllWISE photometry, we introduce an all-sky uniformly derived
    catalog of stellar astrophysical parameters, including dust extinction (A0) and
    average grain size (R0) along the line of sight, for 123,097,070 stars. In contrast
    with previous works, we do not use a Galactic model as prior in our analysis.
    We validate our results against other literature (e.g., benchmark stars, interferometry,
    Bayestar, StarHorse). The limited optical information in the Gaia photometric
    bands or the lack of ultraviolet or spectroscopic information renders the chemistry
    inference prior dominated. We demonstrate that Gaia parallaxes bring sufficient
    leverage to explore the detailed structures of the interstellar medium in our
    Milky Way. In Gaia DR3, we will obtain the dispersed optical light information
    to break through some limitations of this analysis, allowing us to infer stellar
    chemistry in particular. Gaia promises us data to construct the most detailed
    view of the chemo-dynamics of field star populations in our Galaxy. Our catalog
    is available from GAVO at http://dc.g-vo.org/tableinfo/gdr2ap.main (soon Gaia

- abstract: "Context. Gaia Data Release 3 will contain more than a billion sources\
    \ with positions, parallaxes, and proper motions. In addition, for hundreds of\
    \ millions of stars, it will include low-resolution blue photometer (BP) and red\
    \ photometer (RP) spectra. Obtained by dispersing light with prisms, these spectra\
    \ have resolutions that are too low to allow us to measure individual spectral\
    \ lines and bands. However, the combined BP/RP spectra can be used to estimate\
    \ some stellar properties such as T<SUB>eff</SUB>, log g, and [M/H]. <BR /> Aims:\
    \ We investigate the feasibility of using the ExtraTrees algorithm to estimate\
    \ the alpha element to iron abundance ratio [\u03B1/Fe] from low-resolution BP/RP\
    \ spectra. <BR /> Methods: To infer [\u03B1/Fe] from the spectra, we created regression\
    \ models using the ExtraTrees algorithm trained on two samples: a set of synthetic\
    \ spectra and a set of observed spectra from stars that have known [\u03B1/Fe]\
    \ since they have also been observed using the High Efficiency and Resolution\
    \ Multi-Element Spectrograph (HERMES) as part of the Galactic Archaeology with\
    \ HERMES survey. We applied each model to the other sample and to a larger observed\
    \ sample to assess the performance of the models. In addition, we used our models\
    \ to analyse stars from the Gaia-Enceladus structure. <BR /> Results: We find\
    \ that the model trained on synthetic data has some ability to reconstruct [\u03B1\
    /Fe] from synthetic spectra, but little to none when used on observed spectra.\
    \ The model trained on observed data reconstructs realistic [\u03B1/Fe] from observed\
    \ spectra, but only for cool stars (\u2A855000 K) that have the same correlations\
    \ as in the training sample between [\u03B1/Fe] and other properties such as [Fe/H].\
    \ <BR /> Conclusions: Models using the ExtraTrees algorithm can be used to estimate\
    \ [\u03B1/Fe] from low-resolution BP/RP spectra of cool stars. However, they do\
    \ this by exploiting correlations between [\u03B1/Fe] and other parameters, rather\
    \ than the causal effect of [\u03B1/Fe] on the spectrum. Hence, they are unlikely\
    \ to be useful in studies that attempt to distinguish stars that only differ in\
    \ [\u03B1/Fe]."

- abstract: "Statistical studies of cataloged object properties are central to astrophysics.\
    \ But one cannot model those objects' population properties without the sample's\
    \ selection function, the quantitative understanding of which objects could have\
    \ ended up in such a catalog. As didactic introductions to this topic are scarce\
    \ in the astrophysical literature, we provide one here, addressing the following\
    \ questions: What is a selection function? On what arguments q should it depend?\
    \ Over what domain must a selection function be defined? What simplifying approximations\
    \ can be made? And, how is a selection function used in \"modeling\"? We argue\
    \ that volume-complete samples, limited by the faintest objects, reflect a highly\
    \ suboptimal selection function, needlessly reducing the number of bright and\
    \ usually rare sample members. We illustrate these points by a worked example:\
    \ github.com/gaia-unlimited/WD-selection-function, deriving the space density\
    \ of white dwarfs (WDs) in the Galactic neighborhood as a function of their luminosity\
    \ and color, \u03A6<SUB>0</SUB>(M<SUB>G</SUB>, (B - R)) in [mag<SUP>-2</SUP> pc<SUP>-3</SUP>].\
    \ We construct a sample ${ \\mathcal C }$ of 10<SUP>5</SUP> presumed WDs through\
    \ straightforward selection cuts on the Gaia EDR3 catalog in magnitude, color,\
    \ and parallax, q = (G, (B - R), \u03D6). We then combine a simple model for \u03A6\
    <SUB>0</SUB> with this selection function's ${S}_{{ \\mathcal C }}({\\boldsymbol{q}})$\
    \ effective survey volume to estimate \u03A6<SUB>0</SUB>(M<SUB>G</SUB>, (B - R))\
    \ precisely and robustly against the detailed choices for ${S}_{{ \\mathcal C\
    \ }}({\\boldsymbol{q}})$ . This resulting WD luminosity-color function \u03A6\
    <SUB>0</SUB>(M<SUB>G</SUB>, (B - R)) differs dramatically from the initial number\
    \ density distribution in the luminosity-color plane: by orders of magnitude in\

- abstract: "Using the astrometry and integrated photometry from the Gaia Early Data\
    \ Release 3, we map the density variations in the distribution of young upper\
    \ main sequence (UMS) stars, open clusters, and classical Cepheids in the Galactic\
    \ disc within several kiloparsecs of the Sun. We derive maps of relative over-\
    \ and under-dense regions for UMS stars in the Galactic disc using both bivariate\
    \ kernel density estimators and wavelet transformations. The resulting overdensity\
    \ maps exhibit large-scale arches that extend in a clumpy but coherent way over\
    \ the entire sampled volume, indicating the location of the spiral arm segments\
    \ in the vicinity of the Sun. Peaks in the UMS overdensity are well matched by\
    \ the distribution of young and intrinsically bright open clusters. By applying\
    \ a wavelet transformation to a sample of classical Cepheids, we find that their\
    \ overdensities possibly extend the spiral arm segments on a larger scale (\u2243\
    10 kpc from the Sun). While the resulting map based on the UMS sample is generally\

- abstract: Stellar distances constitute a foundational pillar of astrophysics. The
    publication of 1.47 billion stellar parallaxes from Gaia is a major contribution
    to this. Despite Gaia's precision, the majority of these stars are so distant
    or faint that their fractional parallax uncertainties are large, thereby precluding
    a simple inversion of parallax to provide a distance. Here we take a probabilistic
    approach to estimating stellar distances that uses a prior constructed from a
    three-dimensional model of our Galaxy. This model includes interstellar extinction
    and Gaia's variable magnitude limit. We infer two types of distance. The first,
    geometric, uses the parallax with a direction-dependent prior on distance. The
    second, photogeometric, additionally uses the color and apparent magnitude of
    a star, by exploiting the fact that stars of a given color have a restricted range
    of probable absolute magnitudes (plus extinction). Tests on simulated data and
    external validations show that the photogeometric estimates generally have higher
    accuracy and precision for stars with poor parallaxes. We provide a catalog of
    1.47 billion geometric and 1.35 billion photogeometric distances together with
    asymmetric uncertainty measures. Our estimates are quantiles of a posterior probability
    distribution, so they transform invariably and can therefore also be used directly
    in the distance modulus ( $5{\mathrm{log}}_{10}r\,-\,5$ ). The catalog may be
    downloaded or queried using ADQL at various sites (see http://www.mpia.de/~calj/gedr3_distances.html),
    where it can also be cross-matched with the Gaia catalog.

    \ and precisely to broadband stellar photometry. This model must, and does, simultaneously\

    \ of this approach, we train our model on a data set with spectroscopic parameters\

    \ photometry from Gaia, Pan-STARRS 1, Two Micron All Sky Survey and Wide-field\

    \ and photometric surveys, and also results in an improved, T<SUB>eff</SUB>-dependent\
    \ R. As such, it provides a simple and accurate method for predicting photometry\
    \ in stellar evolutionary models. Our model will form a basis to infer stellar\

    \ photons using Hubble Space Telescope imaging of resolved stars in NGC 4214,\
    \ a local analog of high-redshift starburst galaxies that are thought to be responsible\
    \ for cosmic reionization. Specifically, we forward model the UV through near-IR\
    \ spectral energy distributions of \u223C83,000 resolved stars to infer their\
    \ individual ionizing flux outputs. We constrain the local escape fraction by\
    \ comparing the number of ionizing photons produced by stars to the number that\
    \ are either absorbed by dust or consumed by ionizing the surrounding neutral\
    \ hydrogen in individual star-forming regions. We find substantial spatial variation\
    \ in the escape fraction (0%-40%). Integrating over the entire galaxy yields a\
    \ global escape fraction of ${25}_{-15}^{+16}$ %. This value is much higher than\
    \ previous escape fractions of zero reported for this galaxy. We discuss the sources\
    \ of this apparent tension and demonstrate that the viewing angle and 3D interstellar\
    \ medium geometric effects are the cause. If we assume that NGC 4214 has no internal\
    \ dust, like many high-redshift galaxies, we find an escape fraction of 59% (an\

- abstract: "The presence of asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars in clusters provides\
    \ key constraints for stellar models, as has been demonstrated with historical\
    \ data from the Magellanic Clouds. In this work, we look for candidate AGB stars\
    \ in M31 star clusters from the Panchromatic Hubble Andromeda Treasury survey.\
    \ Our photometric criteria selects stars brighter than the tip of the red giant\
    \ branch, which includes the bulk of the thermally pulsing AGB stars as well as\
    \ early-AGB stars and other luminous cool giants expected in young stellar populations\
    \ (e.g., massive red supergiants, and intermediate-mass red helium-burning stars).\
    \ The AGB stars can be differentiated, a posteriori, using the ages already estimated\
    \ for our cluster sample. 937 candidates are found within the cluster aperture\
    \ radii, half (\u223C450) of which are very likely cluster members. Cross-matching\
    \ with additional databases reveals two carbon stars and 10 secure variables among\
    \ them. The field-corrected age distribution reveals the presence of young supergiants\
    \ peaking at ages smaller than 10<SUP>8</SUP> yr, followed by a long tail of AGB\
    \ stars extending up to the oldest possible ages. This long tail reveals the general\

- abstract: "We present a mock stellar catalog, matching in volume, depth and data\
    \ model the content of the planned Gaia early data release 3 (Gaia EDR3). We have\
    \ generated our catalog (GeDR3mock) using galaxia, a tool to sample stars from\
    \ an underlying Milky Way (MW) model or from N-body data. We used an updated Besan\xE7\
    on Galactic model together with the latest PARSEC stellar evolutionary tracks,\
    \ now also including white dwarfs. We added the Magellanic clouds and realistic\
    \ open clusters with internal rotation. We empirically modeled uncertainties based\
    \ on Gaia DR2 (GDR2) and scaled them according to the longer baseline in Gaia\
    \ EDR3. The apparent magnitudes were reddened according to a new selection of\
    \ 3D extinction maps. To help with the Gaia selection function we provide all-sky\
    \ magnitude limit maps in G and BP for a few relevant GDR2 subsets together with\
    \ the routines to produce these maps for user-defined subsets. We supplement the\
    \ catalog with photometry and extinctions in non-Gaia bands. The catalog is available\
    \ in the Virtual Observatory (http://dc.g-vo.org/tableinfo/gedr3mock.main) and\
    \ can be queried just like the actual Gaia EDR3 will be. We highlight a few capabilities\
    \ of the Astronomy Data Query Language with educative catalog queries. We use\
    \ the data extracted from those queries to compare GeDR3mock to GDR2, which emphasises\
    \ the importance of adding observational noise to the mock data. Since the underlying\
    \ truth, e.g., stellar parameters, is know in GeDR3mock, it can be used to construct\
    \ priors as well as mock data tests for parameter estimation. All code, models\
    \ and data used to produce GeDR3mock are linked and contained in galaxia_wrap\

- abstract: 'The extended main-sequence turn offs (eMSTOs) of several young to intermediate
    age clusters are examined in the Magellanic Clouds and the Milky Way. We explore
    the effects of extended star formation (eSF) and a range of stellar rotation rates
    on the behavior of the color-magnitude diagram, paying particular attention to
    the MSTO. We create synthetic stellar populations based on MESA stellar models
    to simulate observed Hubble Space Telescope and Gaia star cluster data. We model
    the effect of rotation as a nonparametric distribution, allowing for maximum flexibility.
    In our models the slow rotators comprise the blueward, and fast rotators the redward
    portion of the eMSTO. We simulate data under three scenarios: nonrotating eSF,
    a range of rotation rates with a single age, and a combination of age and rotation
    effects. We find that two of the five clusters (the youngest and oldest) favor
    an age spread, but these also achieve the overall worst fits of all clusters.
    The other three clusters show comparable statistical evidence between rotation
    and an age spread. In all five cases, a rotation-rate distribution alone is capable
    of qualitatively matching the observed eMSTO structure. In future work, we aim
    to compare our predicted V\sin i with observations in order to better constrain
    the physics related to stellar rotation.'

    \ to classify objects into three classes - star, quasar, galaxy - for G \u2265\
    \ 14.5 mag down to the Gaia magnitude limit of G = 21.0 mag. Galaxies and quasars\
    \ are identified for the training set by a cross-match to objects with spectroscopic\
    \ classifications from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. Stars are defined directly\
    \ from GDR2. When allowing for the expectation that quasars are 500 times rarer\
    \ than stars, and galaxies 7500 times rarer than stars (the class imbalance problem),\
    \ samples classified with a threshold probability of 0.5 are predicted to have\
    \ purities of 0.43 for quasars and 0.28 for galaxies, and completenesses of 0.58\

    \ a higher threshold. Not accounting for this expected low frequency of extragalactic\
    \ objects (the class prior) would give both erroneously optimistic performance\
    \ predictions and severely impure samples. Applying our model to all 1.20 billion\
    \ objects in GDR2 with the required features, we classify 2.3 million objects\
    \ as quasars and 0.37 million objects as galaxies (with individual probabilities\
    \ above 0.5). The small number of galaxies is due to the strong bias of the satellite\
    \ detection algorithm and on-ground data selection against extended objects. We\
    \ infer the true number of quasars and galaxies - as these classes are defined\
    \ by our training set - to be 690 000 and 110 000, respectively (\xB150 per cent).\
    \ The aim of this work is to see how well extragalactic objects can be classified\
    \ using only GDR2 data. Better classifications should be possible with the low\

- abstract: "Observational tests of stellar and Galactic chemical evolution call for\
    \ the joint knowledge of a star\u2019s physical parameters, detailed element abundances,\
    \ and precise age. For cool main-sequence (MS) stars the abundances of many elements\
    \ can be measured from spectroscopy, but ages are very hard to determine. The\
    \ situation is different if the MS star has a white dwarf (WD) companion and a\
    \ known distance, as the age of such a binary system can then be determined precisely\
    \ from the photometric properties of the cooling WD. As a pilot study for obtaining\
    \ precise age determinations of field MS stars, we identify nearly 100 candidates\
    \ for such wide binary systems: a faint WD whose GPS1 proper motion matches that\
    \ of a brighter MS star in Gaia/TGAS with a good parallax (\u03C3 <SUB> \u03D6\
    \ </SUB>/\u03D6 \u2264 0.05). We model the WD\u2019s multi-band photometry with\
    \ the BASE-9 code using this precise distance (assumed to be common for the pair)\
    \ and infer ages for each binary system. The resulting age estimates are precise\
    \ to \u226410% (\u226420%) for 42 (67) MS-WD systems. Our analysis more than doubles\
    \ the number of MS-WD systems with precise distances known to date, and it boosts\
    \ the number of such systems with precise age determination by an order of magnitude.\
    \ With the advent of the Gaia DR2 data, this approach will be applicable to a\
    \ far larger sample, providing ages for many MS stars (that can yield detailed\

- abstract: Using Gaia DR2 astrometry, we map the kinematic signature of the Galactic
    stellar warp out to a distance of 7 kpc from the Sun. Combining Gaia DR2 and 2-Micron
    All Sky Survey photometry, we identify, via a probabilistic approach, 599 494
    upper main sequence (UMS) stars and 12 616 068 giants without the need for individual
    extinction estimates. The spatial distribution of the UMS stars clearly shows
    segments of the nearest spiral arms. The large-scale kinematics of both the UMS
    and giant populations show a clear signature of the warp of the Milky Way, apparent
    as a gradient of 5-6 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> in the vertical velocities from 8 to 14
    kpc in Galactic radius. The presence of the signal in both samples, which have
    different typical ages, suggests that the warp is a gravitationally induced phenomenon.

- abstract: The second Gaia data release (Gaia DR2) contains, beyond the astrometry,
    three-band photometry for 1.38 billion sources. One band is the G band, the other
    two were obtained by integrating the Gaia prism spectra (BP and RP). We have used
    these three broad photometric bands to infer stellar effective temperatures, T<SUB>eff</SUB>,
    for all sources brighter than G = 17 mag with T<SUB>eff</SUB> in the range 3000-10
    000 K (some 161 million sources). Using in addition the parallaxes, we infer the
    line-of-sight extinction, A<SUB>G</SUB>, and the reddening, E(BP - RP), for 88
    million sources. Together with a bolometric correction we derive luminosity and
    radius for 77 million sources. These quantities as well as their estimated uncertainties
    are part of Gaia DR2. Here we describe the procedures by which these quantities
    were obtained, including the underlying assumptions, comparison with literature
    estimates, and the limitations of our results. Typical accuracies are of order
    324 K (T<SUB>eff</SUB>), 0.46 mag (A<SUB>G</SUB>), 0.23 mag (E(BP - RP)), 15%
    (luminosity), and 10% (radius). Being based on only a small number of observable
    quantities and limited training data, our results are necessarily subject to some
    extreme assumptions that can lead to strong systematics in some cases (not included
    in the aforementioned accuracy estimates). One aspect is the non-negativity contraint
    of our estimates, in particular extinction, which we discuss. Yet in several regions
    of parameter space our results show very good performance, for example for red
    clump stars and solar analogues. Large uncertainties render the extinctions less
    useful at the individual star level, but they show good performance for ensemble
    estimates. We identify regimes in which our parameters should and should not be
    used and we define a "clean" sample. Despite the limitations, this is the largest
    catalogue of uniformly-inferred stellar parameters to date. More precise and detailed
    astrophysical parameters based on the full BP/RP spectrophotometry are planned
    as part of the third Gaia data release.

- abstract: "Passing stars may play an important role in the evolution of our solar\
    \ system. We search for close stellar encounters to the Sun among all 7.2 million\
    \ stars in Gaia DR2 that have six-dimensional phase space data. We characterize\
    \ encounters by integrating their orbits through a Galactic potential and propagating\
    \ the correlated uncertainties via a Monte Carlo resampling. After filtering to\
    \ remove spurious data, we find 694 stars that have median (over uncertainties)\
    \ closest encounter distances within 5 pc, all occurring within 15 Myr from now.\
    \ 26 of these have at least a 50% chance of coming closer than 1 pc (and 7 within\
    \ 0.5 pc), all but one of which are newly discovered here. We confirm some and\
    \ refute several other previously-identified encounters, confirming suspicions\
    \ about their data. The closest encounter in the sample is Gl 710, which has a\
    \ 95% probability of coming closer than 0.08 pc (17 000 AU). Taking mass estimates\
    \ obtained from Gaia astrometry and multiband photometry for essentially all encounters,\
    \ we find that Gl 710 also has the largest impulse on the Oort cloud. Using a\
    \ Galaxy model, we compute the completeness of the Gaia DR2 encountering sample\
    \ as a function of perihelion time and distance. Only 15% of encounters within\
    \ 5 pc occurring within \xB15 Myr of now have been identified, mostly due to the\
    \ lack of radial velocities for faint and/or cool stars. Accounting for the incompleteness,\
    \ we infer the present rate of encounters within 1 pc to be 19.7 \xB1 2.2 per\
    \ Myr, a quantity expected to scale quadratically with the encounter distance\
    \ out to at least several pc. Spuriously large parallaxes in our sample from imperfect\
    \ filtering would tend to inflate both the number of encounters found and this\
    \ inferred rate. The magnitude of this effect is hard to quantify. <P />Full Tables\

- abstract: We present a map of the three-dimensional (3D) distribution of dust in
    the Orion complex. Orion is the closest site of high-mass star formation, making
    it an excellent laboratory for studying the interstellar medium and star formation.
    We used data from the Gaia-TGAS catalogue combined with photometry from 2MASS
    and WISE to get the distances and extinctions of individual stars in the vicinity
    of the Orion complex. We use a Gaussian process and adopt a non-parametric method
    to infer the probability distribution function of the dust densities at arbitrary
    points throughout the region. We map the dust distribution towards different parts
    of the Orion complex. We find that the distance and depth of the cloud are compatible
    with other recent works, which show that the method can be applicable to local
    molecular clouds to map their 3D dust distribution. We also demonstrate the danger
    of only using colours of stars to derive their extinctions without considering
    further physical constraints, such as the colour-magnitude diagram (CMD).

- abstract: For the vast majority of stars in the second Gaia data release, reliable
    distances cannot be obtained by inverting the parallax. A correct inference procedure
    must instead be used to account for the nonlinearity of the transformation and
    the asymmetry of the resulting probability distribution. Here, we infer distances
    to essentially all 1.33 billion stars with parallaxes published in the second
    Gaia data release. This is done using a weak distance prior that varies smoothly
    as a function of Galactic longitude and latitude according to a Galaxy model.
    The irreducible uncertainty in the distance estimate is characterized by the lower
    and upper bounds of an asymmetric confidence interval. Although more precise distances
    can be estimated for a subset of the stars using additional data (such as photometry),
    our goal is to provide purely geometric distance estimates, independent of assumptions
    about the physical properties of, or interstellar extinction toward, individual
    stars. We analyze the characteristics of the catalog and validate it using clusters.
    The catalog can be queried using ADQL at <A href="http://gaia.ari.uni-heidelberg.de/tap.html">http://gaia.ari.uni-heidelberg.de/tap.html</A>
    (which also hosts the Gaia catalog) and downloaded from <A href="http://www.mpia.de/~calj/gdr2_distances.html">http://www.mpia.de/~calj/gdr2_distances.html</A>.

- abstract: "We explore to what extent stars within Galactic disk open clusters resemble\
    \ each other in the high-dimensional space of their photospheric element abundances\
    \ and contrast this with pairs of field stars. Our analysis is based on abundances\
    \ for 20 elements, homogeneously derived from APOGEE spectra (with carefully quantified\
    \ uncertainties of typically 0.03 dex). We consider 90 red giant stars in seven\
    \ open clusters and find that most stars within a cluster have abundances in most\

    \ This paper reviews our overall survey strategy and discusses the data processing\

    \ data to the main aims of the survey, which are to gather a large sample of the\
    \ most metal-poor stars in the Galaxy, to further characterize the faintest Milky\
    \ Way satellites, and to map the (metal-poor) substructure in the Galactic halo.\
    \ The current Pristine footprint comprises over 1000 deg<SUP>2</SUP> in the Galactic\
    \ halo ranging from b \u223C 30\xB0 to \u223C78\xB0 and covers many known stellar\
    \ substructures. We demonstrate that, for Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) stellar\

- abstract: "We present a framework to simultaneously constrain the values and uncertainties\
    \ of the strength of convective core overshooting, metallicity, extinction, distance,\
    \ and age in stellar populations. We then apply the framework to archival Hubble\
    \ Space Telescope observations of six stellar clusters in the Large Magellanic\
    \ Cloud that have reported ages between \u223C 1{--}2.5 {Gyr}. Assuming a canonical\
    \ value of the strength of core convective overshooting, we recover the well-known\
    \ age-metallicity correlation, and additional correlations between metallicity\
    \ and extinction and metallicity and distance. If we allow the strength of core\
    \ overshooting to vary, we find that for intermediate-aged stellar clusters, the\
    \ measured values of distance and extinction are negligibly effected by uncertainties\
    \ of core overshooting strength. However, cluster age and metallicity may have\
    \ disconcertingly large systematic shifts when {{{\u039B }}}<SUB>{{c</SUB>}} is\
    \ allowed to vary by more than +/- 0.05 {H}<SUB>p</SUB>. Using the six stellar\
    \ clusters, we combine their posterior distribution functions to obtain the most\

    \ which is in line with canonical values."

- abstract: "We present synthetic far- and near-ultraviolet ({FUV} and {NUV}) maps\
    \ of M31, both with and without dust reddening. These maps were constructed from\
    \ spatially resolved star formation histories (SFHs) derived from optical Hubble\
    \ Space Telescope imaging of resolved stars, taken as part of the Panchromatic\
    \ Hubble Andromeda Treasury program. We use stellar population synthesis modeling\
    \ to generate synthetic UV maps with a spatial resolution of \u223C100 pc (\u223C\
    24 arcsec), projected. When reddening is included, these maps reproduce all of\
    \ the main morphological features in the GALEX imaging, including rings and large\
    \ star-forming complexes. The predicted UV flux also agrees well with the observed\
    \ flux, with median ratios between the modeled and observed flux of {{log}}<SUB>10</SUB>({f}<SUB>{FUV</SUB>}<SUP>{syn</SUP>}/{f}<SUB>{FUV</SUB>}<SUP>{obs</SUP>})=0.03+/-\
    \ 0.24 and {{log}}<SUB>10</SUB>({f}<SUB>{NUV</SUB>}<SUP>{syn</SUP>}/{f}<SUB>{NUV</SUB>}<SUP>{obs</SUP>})=-0.03+/-\

    \ given that we used only optical photometry to construct these UV maps. Having\
    \ verified the synthetic reddened maps, we use the dust-free maps to examine properties\
    \ of obscured flux and star formation. We compare our dust-free and reddened maps\
    \ of {FUV} flux with the observed GALEX {FUV} flux and {FUV} + 24 \u03BCm flux\
    \ to examine the fraction of obscured flux. We find that the maps of synthetic\
    \ flux require that \u223C90% of the {FUV} flux in M31 is obscured by dust, while\
    \ the GALEX -based methods suggest that \u223C70% of the {FUV} flux is absorbed\
    \ by dust. This 30% increase in the estimate of the obscured flux is driven by\
    \ significant differences between the dust-free synthetic {FUV} flux and that\
    \ derived when correcting the observed {FUV} flux for dust absorption with 24\
    \ \u03BCm emission observations. The difference is further illustrated when we\
    \ compare the SFRs derived from the {FUV} + 24 \u03BCm flux with the 100 Myr average\
    \ SFR from the CMD-based SFHs. We find that the 24 \u03BCm corrected {FUV} flux\
    \ underestimates the SFR by a factor of 2.3-2.5, depending on the chosen calibration.\

- abstract: We present a non-parametric model for inferring the three-dimensional
    (3D) distribution of dust density in the Milky Way. Our approach uses the extinction
    measured towards stars at different locations in the Galaxy at approximately known
    distances. Each extinction measurement is proportional to the integrated dust
    density along its line of sight (LoS). Making simple assumptions about the spatial
    correlation of the dust density, we can infer the most probable 3D distribution
    of dust across the entire observed region, including along sight lines which were
    not observed. This is possible because our model employs a Gaussian process to
    connect all LoS. We demonstrate the capability of our model to capture detailed
    dust density variations using mock data and simulated data from the Gaia Universe
    Model Snapshot. We then apply our method to a sample of giant stars observed by
    APOGEE and Kepler to construct a 3D dust map over a small region of the Galaxy.
    Owing to our smoothness constraint and its isotropy, we provide one of the first
    maps which does not show the "fingers of God" effect.

    \ and infrared photometry plus the additional Pristine narrow-band photometry.\
    \ The sample consists of 205 stars in the magnitude range 14 &lt; V &lt; 18. Applying\
    \ the photometric selection criteria cuts the sample down to 149 stars, and from\
    \ these we report a success rate of 70 per cent for finding stars with [Fe/H]\
    \ \u2264 -2.5 and 22 per cent for finding stars with [Fe/H] \u2264 -3.0. These\
    \ statistics compare favourably with other surveys that search for extremely metal-poor\

    \ with [Fe/H] \u2264 -3.0. In addition, Pristine covers a fainter magnitude range\

- abstract: We present the Bayesian Extinction And Stellar Tool (BEAST), a probabilistic
    approach to modeling the dust extinguished photometric spectral energy distribution
    of an individual star while accounting for observational uncertainties common
    to large resolved star surveys. Given a set of photometric measurements and an
    observational uncertainty model, the BEAST infers the physical properties of the
    stellar source using stellar evolution and atmosphere models and constrains the
    line of sight extinction using a newly developed mixture model that encompasses
    the full range of dust extinction curves seen in the Local Group. The BEAST is
    specifically formulated for use with large multi-band surveys of resolved stellar
    populations. Our approach accounts for measurement uncertainties and any covariance
    between them due to stellar crowding (both systematic biases and uncertainties
    in the bias) and absolute flux calibration, thereby incorporating the full information
    content of the measurement. We illustrate the accuracy and precision possible
    with the BEAST using data from the Panchromatic Hubble Andromeda Treasury. While
    the BEAST has been developed for this survey, it can be easily applied to similar
    existing and planned resolved star surveys. <P />Based on observations made with

- abstract: "In the Milky Way, the thick disk can be defined using individual stellar\
    \ abundances, kinematics, or age, or geometrically, as stars high above the midplane.\
    \ In nearby galaxies, where only a geometric definition can be used, thick disks\
    \ appear to have large radial scale lengths, and their red colors suggest that\
    \ they are uniformly old. The Milky Way\u2019s geometrically thick disk is also\
    \ radially extended, but it is far from chemically uniform: \u03B1-enhanced stars\
    \ are confined within the inner Galaxy. In simulated galaxies, where old stars\
    \ are centrally concentrated, geometrically thick disks are radially extended,\
    \ too. Younger stellar populations flare in the simulated disks\u2019 outer regions,\
    \ bringing those stars high above the midplane. The resulting geometrically thick\
    \ disks therefore show a radial age gradient, from old in their central regions\
    \ to younger in their outskirts. Based on our age estimates for a large sample\
    \ of giant stars in the APOGEE survey, we can now test this scenario for the Milky\
    \ Way. We find that the geometrically defined thick disk in the Milky Way has\
    \ indeed a strong radial age gradient: the median age for red clump stars goes\
    \ from \u223C9 Gyr in the inner disk to 5 Gyr in the outer disk. We propose that\
    \ at least some nearby galaxies could also have thick disks that are not uniformly\
    \ old, and that geometrically thick disks might be complex structures resulting\
    \ from different formation mechanisms in their inner and outer parts."

    \ high spatial resolution observations of [C II] in M31 with the Survey of Lines\
    \ in M31. We present five ~700 \xD7 700 pc (3' \xD7 3') fields mapping the [C\
    \ II] emission, H\u03B1 emission, and the ancillary infrared (IR) data. We spatially\
    \ separate star-forming regions from diffuse gas and dust emission on ~50 pc scales.\
    \ We find that the [C II]-SFR correlation holds even at these scales, although\
    \ the relation typically has a flatter slope than found at larger (kiloparsec)\
    \ scales. While the H\u03B1 emission in M31 is concentrated in the SFR regions,\
    \ we find that a significant amount (~20%-90%) of the [C II] emission comes from\
    \ outside star-forming regions and that the total IR emission (TIR) has the highest\
    \ diffuse fraction of all SFR tracers. We find a weak correlation of the [C II]/TIR\
    \ to dust color in each field and find a large-scale trend of increasing [C II]/TIR\
    \ with galactocentric radius. The differences in the relative diffuse fractions\
    \ of [C II], H\u03B1, and IR tracers are likely caused by a combination of energetic\
    \ photon leakage from H II regions and heating by the diffuse radiation field\
    \ arising from older (B-star) stellar populations. However, we find that by averaging\
    \ our measurements over kiloparsec scales, these effects are minimized, and the\
    \ relation between [C II] and SFR found in other nearby galaxy studies is retrieved."

    \ whether such age gradients are present in M81 by deriving the recent star formation\
    \ histories (SFHs) of 20 regions around one of M81's grand-design spiral arms.\
    \ For each region, we use resolved stellar populations to determine the SFH by\
    \ modeling the observed color-magnitude diagram constructed from archival Hubble\
    \ Space Telescope F435W and F606W imaging. Although we should be able to detect\
    \ systematic time delays in our spatially resolved SFHs, we find no evidence of\
    \ star formation propagation across the spiral arm. Our data therefore provide\
    \ no convincing evidence for a stationary density wave with a single pattern speed\

- abstract: We present a sample of 11 M31 Cepheids in stellar clusters, derived from
    the overlap of the Panchromatic Hubble Andromeda Treasury cluster catalog and
    the Pan-STARRS1 (PS1) disk Cepheid catalog. After identifying the PS1 Cepheids
    in the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) catalog, we calibrate the PS1 mean magnitudes
    using the higher resolution HST photometry, revealing up to 1 mag offsets due
    to crowding effects in the ground-based catalog. We measure ages of the clusters
    by performing single-age stellar population fits to their color-magnitude diagrams
    excluding their Cepheids. From these cluster age measurements, we derive an empirical
    period-age relation which agrees well with the existing literature values. By
    confirming this relation for M31 Cepheids, we justify its application in high-precision
    pointwise age estimation across M31.

    \ square degree area (\u223C380 kpc<SUP>2</SUP>, deprojected) in the NE quadrant\
    \ of M31. We show that the SFHs vary significantly on these small spatial scales\
    \ but that there are also coherent galaxy-wide fluctuations in the SFH back to\
    \ \u223C500 Myr, most notably in M31's 10 kpc star-forming ring. We find that\
    \ the 10 kpc ring is at least 400 Myr old, showing ongoing star formation (SF)\
    \ over the past \u223C500 Myr. This indicates the presence of molecular gas in\
    \ the ring over at least 2 dynamical times at this radius. We also find that the\
    \ ring\u2019s position is constant throughout this time, and is stationary at\

    \ of the ring due to the diffusion of stars into the disk. Based on existing models\
    \ of M31's ring features, the lack of evolution in the ring\u2019s position makes\
    \ a purely collisional ring origin highly unlikely. Besides the well-known 10\

    \ star clusters (10<SUP>3</SUP>-10<SUP>4</SUP> M<SUB>\u2299</SUB>), observed as\
    \ part of the Panchromatic Hubble Andromeda Treasury program. We fit each cluster\u2019\
    s CMD to measure its mass function (MF) slope for stars \u22732 M<SUB>\u2299</SUB>.\
    \ By modeling the ensemble of clusters, we find the distribution of MF slopes\
    \ is best described by \u0393 = +{1.45}<SUB>-0.06</SUB><SUP>+0.03</SUP> with a\
    \ very small intrinsic scatter and no drastic outliers. This model allows the\
    \ MF slope to depend on cluster mass, size, and age, but the data imply no significant\
    \ dependencies within this regime of cluster properties. The lack of an age dependence\
    \ suggests that the MF slope has not significantly evolved over the first \u223C\
    25 Myr and provides direct observational evidence that the measured MF represents\
    \ the IMF. Taken together, this analysis\u2014based on an unprecedented large\
    \ sample of young clusters, homogeneously constructed CMDs, well-defined selection\
    \ criteria, and consistent principled modeling\u2014implies that the high-mass\
    \ IMF slope in M31 clusters is universal. The IMF has a slope (\u0393 = +{1.45}<SUB>-0.06</SUB><SUP>+0.03</SUP>;\
    \ statistical uncertainties) that is slightly steeper than the canonical Kroupa\
    \ (+1.30) and Salpeter (+1.35) values, and our measurement of it represents a\
    \ factor of \u223C20 improvement in precision over the Kroupa IMF (+1.30 \xB1\
    \ 0.7). Using our inference model on select Milky Way (MW) and LMC high-mass IMF\

    \ 0.1 and {\u0393 }<SUB>{LMC</SUB>}\u223C +1.3+/- 0.1, both with intrinsic scatter\
    \ of \u223C0.3-0.4 dex. Thus, while the high-mass IMF in the Local Group may be\
    \ universal, systematics in the literature of IMF studies preclude any definitive\
    \ conclusions; homogenous investigations of the high-mass IMF in the local universe\
    \ are needed to overcome this limitation. Consequently, the present study represents\
    \ the most robust measurement of the high-mass IMF slope to date. To facilitate\
    \ practical use over the full stellar mass spectrum, we have grafted the M31 high-mass\
    \ IMF slope onto widely used sub-solar mass Kroupa and Chabrier IMFs. The increased\
    \ steepness in the M31 high-mass IMF slope implies that commonly used UV- and\
    \ H\u03B1-based star formation rates should be increased by a factor of \u223C\
    1.3-1.5 and the number of stars with masses \\gt 8 M<SUB>\u2299</SUB> is \u223C\

    Hubble Andromeda Treasury program that also provides stellar parameters derived
    from the individual energy distributions, our analysis is focused on the young
    stars in three star-forming regions, located at galactocentric distances of about
    5, 10, and 15 kpc, corresponding to the inner spiral arms, the ring structure,
    and the outer arm, respectively. We apply the two-point correlation function to
    our selected sample to investigate the clustering behavior of these stars across
    different time- and length-scales. We find that young stellar structure survives
    across the whole extent of M31 longer than 300 Myr. Stellar distribution in all
    regions appears to be self-similar, with younger stars being systematically more
    strongly clustered than the older, which are more dispersed. The observed clustering
    is interpreted as being induced by turbulence, the driving source for which is
    probably gravitational instabilities driven by the spiral arms, which are stronger
    closer to the galactic centre.

- abstract: "In order to empirically determine the time-scale and environmental dependence\
    \ of stellar cluster disruption, we have undertaken an analysis of the unprecedented\
    \ multipointing (seven), multiwavelength (U, B, V, H\u03B1, and I) Hubble Space\
    \ Telescope imaging survey of the nearby, face-on spiral galaxy M83. The images\
    \ are used to locate stellar clusters and stellar associations throughout the\
    \ galaxy. Estimation of cluster properties (age, mass, and extinction) was done\
    \ through a comparison of their spectral energy distributions with simple stellar\
    \ population models. We constructed the largest catalogue of stellar clusters\
    \ and associations in this galaxy to-date, with \u223C1800 sources with masses\
    \ above \u223C5000 M<SUB>\u2299</SUB> and ages younger than \u223C300 Myr. In\
    \ this Letter, we focus on the age distribution of the resulting clusters and\
    \ associations. In particular, we explicitly test whether the age distributions\
    \ are related with the ambient environment. Our results are in excellent agreement\
    \ with previous studies of age distributions in the centre of the galaxy, which\
    \ gives us confidence to expand out to search for similarities or differences\
    \ in the other fields which sample different environments. We find that the age\
    \ distribution of the clusters inside M83 varies strongly as a function of position\
    \ within the galaxy, indicating a strong correlation with the galactic environment.\
    \ If the age distributions are approximated as a power law of the form {d N/dt}\u221D\
    \ t^{\u03B6 }, we find \u03B6 values between 0 and -0.62 (\u03B6 \u223C -0.40\
    \ for the whole galaxy), in good agreement with previous results and theoretical\

- abstract: We present a study on the gender balance, in speakers and attendees, at
    the recent major astronomical conference, the American Astronomical Society meeting
    223, in Washington, DC. We conducted an informal survey, yielding over 300 responses
    by volunteers at the meeting. Each response included gender data about a single
    talk given at the meeting, recording the gender of the speaker and all question-askers.
    In total, 225 individual AAS talks were sampled. We analyze basic statistical
    properties of this sample. We find that the gender ratio of the speakers closely
    matched the gender ratio of the conference attendees. The audience asked an average
    of 2.8 questions per talk. Talks given by women had a slightly higher number of
    questions asked (3.2$\pm$0.2) than talks given by men (2.6$\pm$0.1). The most
    significant result from this study is that while the gender ratio of speakers
    very closely mirrors that of conference attendees, women are under-represented
    in the question-asker category. We interpret this to be an age-effect, as senior
    scientists may be more likely to ask questions, and are more commonly men. A strong
    dependence on the gender of session chairs is found, whereby women ask disproportionately
    fewer questions in sessions chaired by men. While our results point to laudable
    progress in gender-balanced speaker selection, we believe future surveys of this
    kind would help ensure that collaboration at such meetings is as inclusive as
    possible.

- abstract: We search the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Advanced Camera for Surveys
    and Wide Field Camera 3 broadband imaging data from the Panchromatic Hubble Andromeda
    Treasury (PHAT) survey to identify detections of cataloged planetary nebulae (PNs).
    Of the 711 PNs currently in the literature within the PHAT footprint, we find
    467 detected in the broadband. For these 467, we are able to refine their astrometric
    accuracy from ~0.''3 to 0.''05. Using the resolution of the HST, we are able to
    show that 152 objects currently in the catalogs are definitively not PNs, and
    we show that 32 objects thought to be extended in ground-based images are actually
    point-like and therefore good PN candidates. We also find one PN candidate that
    is marginally resolved. If this is a PN, it is up to 0.7 pc in diameter. With
    our new photometric data, we develop a method of measuring the level of excitation
    in individual PNs by comparing broadband and narrowband imaging and describe the
    effects of excitation on a PN's photometric signature. Using the photometric properties
    of the known PNs in the PHAT catalogs, we search for more PNs, but do not find
    any new candidates, suggesting that ground-based emission-line surveys are complete
    in the PHAT footprint to F475W ~= 24.

- abstract: "We present a probabilistic approach for inferring the parameters of the\
    \ present-day power-law stellar mass function (MF) of a resolved young star cluster.\
    \ This technique (1) fully exploits the information content of a given data set;\
    \ (2) can account for observational uncertainties in a straightforward way; (3)\
    \ assigns meaningful uncertainties to the inferred parameters; (4) avoids the\
    \ pitfalls associated with binning data; and (5) can be applied to virtually any\
    \ resolved young cluster, laying the groundwork for a systematic study of the\
    \ high-mass stellar MF (M &gt;~ 1 M <SUB>\u2299</SUB>). Using simulated clusters\
    \ and Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling of the probability distribution functions,\
    \ we show that estimates of the MF slope, \u03B1, are unbiased and that the uncertainty,\
    \ \u0394\u03B1, depends primarily on the number of observed stars and on the range\
    \ of stellar masses they span, assuming that the uncertainties on individual masses\
    \ and the completeness are both well characterized. Using idealized mock data,\
    \ we compute the theoretical precision, i.e., lower limits, on \u03B1, and provide\
    \ an analytic approximation for \u0394\u03B1 as a function of the observed number\
    \ of stars and mass range. Comparison with literature studies shows that ~3/4\
    \ of quoted uncertainties are smaller than the theoretical lower limit. By correcting\
    \ these uncertainties to the theoretical lower limits, we find that the literature\
    \ studies yield lang\u03B1rang = 2.46, with a 1\u03C3 dispersion of 0.35 dex.\
    \ We verify that it is impossible for a power-law MF to obtain meaningful constraints\
    \ on the upper mass limit of the initial mass function, beyond the lower bound\
    \ of the most massive star actually observed. We show that avoiding substantial\
    \ biases in the MF slope requires (1) including the MF as a prior when deriving\
    \ individual stellar mass estimates, (2) modeling the uncertainties in the individual\
    \ stellar masses, and (3) fully characterizing and then explicitly modeling the\
    \ completeness for stars of a given mass. The precision on MF slope recovery in\
    \ this paper are lower limits, as we do not explicitly consider all possible sources\
    \ of uncertainty, including dynamical effects (e.g., mass segregation), unresolved\
    \ binaries, and non-coeval populations. We briefly discuss how each of these effects\

- abstract: "The majority of clusters in the universe have masses well below 10<SUP>5</SUP>\
    \ M <SUB>\u2299</SUB>. Hence, their integrated fluxes and colors can be affected\
    \ by the presence or absence of a few bright stars introduced by stochastic sampling\
    \ of the stellar mass function. Specific methods are being developed to extend\
    \ the analysis of cluster energy distributions into the low-mass regime. In this\
    \ paper, we apply such a method to real observations of star clusters, in the\
    \ nearby spiral galaxy M83. We reassess the ages and masses of a sample of 1242\
    \ clusters for which UBVIH\u03B1 fluxes were obtained from observations with the\
    \ Wide Field Camera 3 instrument on board the Hubble Space Telescope. Synthetic\
    \ clusters with known properties are used to characterize the limitations of the\
    \ method (valid range and resolution in age and mass, method artifacts). The ensemble\
    \ of color predictions of the discrete cluster models are in good agreement with\
    \ the distribution of observed colors. We emphasize the important role of the\
    \ H\u03B1 data in the assessment of the fraction of young objects, particularly\
    \ in breaking the age-extinction degeneracy that hampers an analysis based on\
    \ UBVI data only. We find the mass distribution of the cluster sample to follow\
    \ a power law of index -2.1 \xB1 0.2, and the distribution of ages a power law\
    \ of index -1.0 \xB1 0.2 for log (M/ M <SUB>\u2299</SUB>) &gt; 3.5, and ages between\
    \ 10<SUP>7</SUP> and 10<SUP>9</SUP> yr. An extension of our main method, which\
    \ makes full use of the probability distributions of age and mass obtained for\
    \ the individual clusters of the sample, is explored. It produces similar power-law\
    \ slopes and will deserve further investigation. Although the properties derived\
    \ for individual clusters significantly differ from those obtained with traditional,\
    \ non-stochastic models in about 30% of the objects, the first-order aspect of\
    \ the age and mass distributions is similar to those obtained previously for this\
    \ M83 sample in the range of overlap of the studies. We extend the power-law description\
    \ to lower masses with better mass and age resolution and without most of the\
    \ artifacts produced by the classical method."

    \ any young coeval population that likely produced the progenitor star, then assign\
    \ an age and uncertainty to that population. Application of stellar evolution\
    \ models allows us to infer the M <SUB>ZAMS</SUB> from this age. Because our technique\
    \ is not contingent on identification or precise location of the progenitor star,\
    \ it can be applied to the location of any known SNRs. We identify significant\
    \ young star formation around 53 of the 59 SNRs and assign progenitor masses to\

- abstract: We study the relationship between the field star formation and cluster
    formation properties in a large sample of nearby dwarf galaxies. We use optical
    data from the Hubble Space Telescope and from ground-based telescopes to derive
    the ages and masses of the young (t <SUB>age</SUB> &lt;~ 100 Myr) cluster sample.
    Our data provide the first constraints on two proposed relationships between the
    star formation rate (SFR) of galaxies and the properties of their cluster systems
    in the low SFR regime. The data show broad agreement with these relationships,
    but significant galaxy-to-galaxy scatter exists. In part, this scatter can be
    accounted for by simulating the small number of clusters detected from stochastically
    sampling the cluster mass function. However, this stochasticity does not fully
    account for the observed scatter in our data, suggesting that there may be true
    variations in the fraction of stars formed in clusters in dwarf galaxies. Comparison
    of the cluster formation and the brightest cluster in our sample galaxies also
    provide constraints on cluster destruction models.

    Efficiency of nearby Dwarf Galaxies

- abstract: The Panchromatic Hubble Andromeda Treasury (PHAT) survey is an ongoing
    Hubble Space Telescope (HST) multi-cycle program to obtain high spatial resolution
    imaging of one-third of the M31 disk at ultraviolet through near-infrared wavelengths.
    In this paper, we present the first installment of the PHAT stellar cluster catalog.
    When completed, the PHAT cluster catalog will be among the largest and most comprehensive
    surveys of resolved star clusters in any galaxy. The exquisite spatial resolution
    achieved with HST has allowed us to identify hundreds of new clusters that were
    previously inaccessible with existing ground-based surveys. We identify 601 clusters
    in the Year 1 sample, representing more than a factor of four increase over previous
    catalogs within the current survey area (390 arcmin<SUP>2</SUP>). This work presents
    results derived from the first ~25% of the survey data; we estimate that the final
    sample will include ~2500 clusters. For the Year 1 objects, we present a catalog
    with positions, radii, and six-band integrated photometry. Along with a general
    characterization of the cluster luminosities and colors, we discuss the cluster
    luminosity function, the cluster size distributions, and highlight a number of
    individually interesting clusters found in the Year 1 search.

  title: The Panchromatic Hubble Andromeda Treasury. III. Measuring Ages and Masses
    of Partially Resolved Stellar Clusters
  url: null
  volume: '760'
  year: 2012
- abstract: "This contribution addresses the question of whether the initial cluster\
    \ mass function (ICMF) has a fundamental limit (or truncation) at high masses.\
    \ The shape of the ICMF at high masses can be studied using the most massive young\
    \ (&lt;10 Myr) clusters, however this has proven difficult due to low-number statistics.\
    \ In this contribution we use an alternative method based on the luminosities\
    \ of the brightest clusters, combined with their ages. The advantages are that\
    \ more clusters can be used and that the ICMF leaves a distinct pattern on the\
    \ global relation between the cluster luminosity and median age within a population.\
    \ If a truncation is present, a generic prediction (nearly independent of the\
    \ cluster disruption law adopted) is that the median age of bright clusters should\
    \ be younger than that of fainter clusters. In the case of an non-truncated ICMF,\
    \ the median age should be independent of cluster luminosity. Here, we present\
    \ optical spectroscopy of twelve young stellar clusters in the face-on spiral\
    \ galaxy NGC 2997. The spectra are used to estimate the age of each cluster, and\
    \ the brightness of the clusters is taken from the literature. The observations\
    \ are compared with the model expectations of Larsen (2009, A&amp;A, 494, 539)\
    \ for various ICMF forms and both mass dependent and mass independent cluster\
    \ disruption. While there exists some degeneracy between the truncation mass and\
    \ the amount of mass independent disruption, the observations favour a truncated\
    \ ICMF. For low or modest amounts of mass independent disruption, a truncation\
    \ mass of 5-6 \xD7 10<SUP>5</SUP> M<SUB>\u2299</SUB> is estimated, consistent\
    \ with previous determinations. Additionally, we investigate possible truncations\
    \ in the ICMF in the spiral galaxy M 83, the interacting Antennae galaxies, and\
    \ the collection of spiral and dwarf galaxies present in Larsen (2009, A&amp;A,\
    \ 494, 539) based on photometric catalogues taken from the literature, and find\
    \ that all catalogues are consistent with having a truncation in the cluster mass\
    \ functions. However for the case of the Antennae, we find a truncation mass of\
    \ a few \xD7 10<SUP>6</SUP>M<SUB>\u2299</SUB> , suggesting a dependence on the\
    \ environment, as has been previously suggested."

  title: Spectroscopic constraints on the form of the stellar cluster mass function
  url: null
  volume: '541'
  year: 2012
- abstract: 'Context. Star clusters are studied widely both as benchmarks for stellar
    evolution models and in their own right. Cluster age distributions and mass distributions
    within galaxies are probes of star formation histories and of cluster formation
    and disruption processes. The vast majority of clusters in the Universe are small,
    and it is well known that the integrated fluxes and colours of all but the most
    massive ones have broad probability distributions, owing to small numbers of bright
    stars. <BR /> Aims: This paper goes beyond describing predicted probability distributions
    to present results of the analysis of cluster energy distributions in an explicitly
    stochastic context. <BR /> Methods: The method developed is Bayesian. It provides
    posterior probability distributions in the age-mass-extinction space, using multi-wavelength
    photometric observations and a large collection of Monte-Carlo simulations of
    clusters of finite stellar masses. The main priors are the assumed intrinsic distributions
    of current mass and current age for clusters in a galaxy. Both UBVI and UBVIK
    data sets are considered, and the study conducted in this paper is restricted
    to the solar metallicity. <BR /> Results: We first use the collection of simulations
    to reassess and explain errors arising from the use of standard analysis methods,
    which are based on continuous population synthesis models: systematic errors on
    ages and random errors on masses are large, while systematic errors on masses
    tend to be smaller. The age-mass distributions obtained after analysis of a synthetic
    sample are very similar to those found for real galaxies in the literature. The
    Bayesian approach, on the other hand, is very successful in recovering the input
    ages and masses over ages ranging between 20 Myr and 1.5 Gyr, with only limited
    systematics that we explain. <BR /> Conclusions: Considering stochasticity is
    important, more important for instance than the choice of adding or removing near-IR
    data in many cases. We found no immediately obvious reason to reject priors inspired
    by previous (standard) analyses of cluster populations in galaxies, i.e., cluster
    distributions that scale with mass as M<SUP>-2</SUP> and are uniform on a logarithmic
    age scale.'

  title: Accounting for stochastic fluctuations when analysing the integrated light
    of star clusters. I. First systematics
  url: null
  volume: '521'
  year: 2010
- abstract: A new method for the automatic detection and tracking of solar filaments
    is presented. The method addresses the problems facing existing catalogs, such
    as the one developed recently in the frame of the European Grid of Solar Observations
    (EGSO) project. In particular, it takes into account the structural and temporal
    evolution of filaments, differences in intensity as seen from one observation
    to the next, and the possibility of sudden disappearance followed by reappearance.
    In this study, the problem of tracking is solved by plotting all detected filaments
    during each solar rotation on a Carrington map and then by applying region growing
    techniques on those plots. Using this approach, the "fixed" positions of the envelopes
    in the Carrington system can be deduced. This is followed by a backward tracking
    of each filament by considering one full solar rotation. The resulting shifted
    Carrington map then enables one to follow any filament from one rotation to the
    next. Such maps should prove valuable for studies of the role of filaments in
    solar activity, notably coronal mass ejections (CMEs).

- abstract: Gaia-CRF3 is the celestial reference frame for positions and proper motions
    in the third release of data from the Gaia mission, Gaia DR3 (and for the early
    third release, Gaia EDR3, which contains identical astrometric results). The reference
    frame is defined by the positions and proper motions at epoch 2016.0 for a specific
    set of extragalactic sources in the (E)DR3 catalogue. We describe the construction
    of Gaia-CRF3, and its properties in terms of the distributions in magnitude, colour,
    and astrometric quality. Compact extragalactic sources in Gaia DR3 were identified
    by positional cross-matching with 17 external catalogues of quasars (QSO) and
    active galactic nuclei (AGN), followed by astrometric filtering designed to remove
    stellar contaminants. Selecting a clean sample was favoured over including a higher
    number of extragalactic sources. For the final sample, the random and systematic
    errors in the proper motions are analysed, as well as the radio-optical offsets
    in position for sources in the third realisation of the International Celestial
    Reference Frame (ICRF3). The Gaia-CRF3 comprises about 1.6 million QSO-like sources,
    of which 1.2 million have five-parameter astrometric solutions in Gaia DR3 and
    0.4 million have six-parameter solutions. The sources span the magnitude range
    G = 13 to 21 with a peak density at 20.6 mag, at which the typical positional
    uncertainty is about 1 mas. The proper motions show systematic errors on the level
    of 12 ${\mu}$as yr${}^{-1}$ on angular scales greater than 15 deg. For the 3142
    optical counterparts of ICRF3 sources in the S/X frequency bands, the median offset
    from the radio positions is about 0.5 mas, but exceeds 4 mas in either coordinate
    for 127 sources. We outline the future of the Gaia-CRF in the next Gaia data releases.

- abstract: '<BR /> Aims: We produce a clean and well-characterised catalogue of objects
    within 100 pc of the Sun from the Gaia Early Data Release 3. We characterise the
    catalogue through comparisons to the full data release, external catalogues, and
    simulations. We carry out a first analysis of the science that is possible with
    this sample to demonstrate its potential and best practices for its use. <BR />
    Methods: Theselection of objects within 100 pc from the full catalogue used selected
    training sets, machine-learning procedures, astrometric quantities, and solution
    quality indicators to determine a probability that the astrometric solution is
    reliable. The training set construction exploited the astrometric data, quality
    flags, and external photometry. For all candidates we calculated distance posterior
    probability densities using Bayesian procedures and mock catalogues to define
    priors. Any object with reliable astrometry and a non-zero probability of being
    within 100 pc is included in the catalogue. <BR /> Results: We have produced a
    catalogue of 331 312 objects that we estimate contains at least 92% of stars of
    stellar type M9 within 100 pc of the Sun. We estimate that 9% of the stars in
    this catalogue probably lie outside 100 pc, but when the distance probability
    function is used, a correct treatment of this contamination is possible. We produced
    luminosity functions with a high signal-to-noise ratio for the main-sequence stars,
    giants, and white dwarfs. We examined in detail the Hyades cluster, the white
    dwarf population, and wide-binary systems and produced candidate lists for all
    three samples. We detected local manifestations of several streams, superclusters,
    and halo objects, in which we identified 12 members of Gaia Enceladus. We present
    the first direct parallaxes of five objects in multiple systems within 10 pc of
    the Sun. <BR /> Conclusions: We provide the community with a large, well-characterised
    catalogue of objects in the solar neighbourhood. This is a primary benchmark for
    measuring and understanding fundamental parameters and descriptive functions in
    astronomy. <P />Tables are only available at the CDS via anonymous ftp to <A href="http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr">cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr</A>

  title: Gaia Early Data Release 3. The Gaia Catalogue of Nearby Stars
  url: null
  volume: '649'
  year: 2021
- abstract: "Context. We present the early installment of the third Gaia data release,\
    \ Gaia EDR3, consisting of astrometry and photometry for 1.8 billion sources brighter\
    \ than magnitude 21, complemented with the list of radial velocities from Gaia\
    \ DR2. <BR /> Aims: A summary of the contents of Gaia EDR3 is presented, accompanied\
    \ by a discussion on the differences with respect to Gaia DR2 and an overview\
    \ of the main limitations which are present in the survey. Recommendations are\
    \ made on the responsible use of Gaia EDR3 results. <BR /> Methods: The raw data\
    \ collected with the Gaia instruments during the first 34 months of the mission\
    \ have been processed by the Gaia Data Processing and Analysis Consortium and\
    \ turned into this early third data release, which represents a major advance\
    \ with respect to Gaia DR2 in terms of astrometric and photometric precision,\
    \ accuracy, and homogeneity. <BR /> Results: Gaia EDR3 contains celestial positions\
    \ and the apparent brightness in G for approximately 1.8 billion sources. For\
    \ 1.5 billion of those sources, parallaxes, proper motions, and the (G<SUB>BP</SUB>\
    \ \u2212 G<SUB>RP</SUB>) colour are also available. The passbands for G, G<SUB>BP</SUB>,\
    \ and G<SUB>RP</SUB> are provided as part of the release. For ease of use, the\
    \ 7 million radial velocities from Gaia DR2 are included in this release, after\
    \ the removal of a small number of spurious values. New radial velocities will\
    \ appear as part of Gaia DR3. Finally, Gaia EDR3 represents an updated materialisation\
    \ of the celestial reference frame (CRF) in the optical, the Gaia-CRF3, which\
    \ is based solely on extragalactic sources. The creation of the source list for\
    \ Gaia EDR3 includes enhancements that make it more robust with respect to high\
    \ proper motion stars, and the disturbing effects of spurious and partially resolved\
    \ sources. The source list is largely the same as that for Gaia DR2, but it does\
    \ feature new sources and there are some notable changes. The source list will\
    \ not change for Gaia DR3. <BR /> Conclusions: Gaia EDR3 represents a significant\
    \ advance over Gaia DR2, with parallax precisions increased by 30 per cent, proper\
    \ motion precisions increased by a factor of 2, and the systematic errors in the\
    \ astrometry suppressed by 30-40% for the parallaxes and by a factor ~2.5 for\
    \ the proper motions. The photometry also features increased precision, but above\
    \ all much better homogeneity across colour, magnitude, and celestial position.\
    \ A single passband for G, G<SUB>BP</SUB>, and G<SUB>RP</SUB> is valid over the\
    \ entire magnitude and colour range, with no systematics above the 1% level"

- abstract: "Context. Gaia Early Data Release 3 (Gaia EDR3) provides accurate astrometry\
    \ for about 1.6 million compact (QSO-like) extragalactic sources, 1.2 million\
    \ of which have the best-quality five-parameter astrometric solutions. <BR />\
    \ Aims: The proper motions of QSO-like sources are used to reveal a systematic\
    \ pattern due to the acceleration of the solar systembarycentre with respect to\
    \ the rest frame of the Universe. Apart from being an important scientific result\
    \ by itself, the acceleration measured in this way is a good quality indicator\
    \ of the Gaia astrometric solution. <BR /> Methods: Theeffect of the acceleration\
    \ was obtained as a part of the general expansion of the vector field of proper\
    \ motions in vector spherical harmonics (VSH). Various versions of the VSH fit\
    \ and various subsets of the sources were tried and compared to get the most consistent\
    \ result and a realistic estimate of its uncertainty. Additional tests with the\
    \ Gaia astrometric solution were used to get a better idea of the possible systematic\
    \ errors in the estimate. <BR /> Results: Our best estimate of the acceleration\
    \ based on Gaia EDR3 is (2.32 \xB1 0.16) \xD7 10<SUP>\u221210</SUP> m s<SUP>\u2212\
    2</SUP> (or 7.33 \xB10.51 km s<SUP>\u22121</SUP> Myr\u22121) towards \u03B1 =\
    \ 269.1\xB0 \xB1 5.4\xB0, \u03B4 = \u221231.6\xB0 \xB1 4.1\xB0, corresponding\
    \ to a proper motion amplitude of 5.05 \xB10.35 \u03BCas yr<SUP>\u22121</SUP>.\
    \ This is in good agreement with the acceleration expected from current models\
    \ of the Galactic gravitational potential. We expect that future Gaia data releases\
    \ will provide estimates of the acceleration with uncertainties substantially\
    \ below 0.1 \u03BCas yr<SUP>\u22121</SUP>. <P />Movie is only available at <A\

  title: Gaia Early Data Release 3. Acceleration of the Solar System from Gaia astrometry
  url: null
  volume: '649'
  year: 2021
- abstract: '<BR /> Aims: We aim to demonstrate the scientific potential of the Gaia
    Early Data Release 3 (EDR3) for the study of different aspects of the Milky Way
    structure and evolution and we provide, at the same time, a description of several
    practical aspects of the data and examples of their usage. <BR /> Methods: We
    used astrometric positions, proper motions, parallaxes, and photometry from EDR3
    to select different populations and components and to calculate the distances
    and velocities in the direction of the anticentre. In this direction, the Gaia
    astrometric data alone enable the calculation of the vertical and azimuthal velocities;
    also, the extinction is relatively low compared to other directions in the Galactic
    plane. We then explore the disturbances of the current disc, the spatial and kinematical
    distributions of early accreted versus in situ stars, the structures in the outer
    parts of the disc, and the orbits of open clusters Berkeley 29 and Saurer 1. <BR
    /> Results: With the improved astrometry and photometry of EDR3, we find that:
    (i) the dynamics of the Galactic disc are very complex with oscillations in the
    median rotation and vertical velocities as a function of radius, vertical asymmetries,
    and new correlations, including a bimodality with disc stars with large angular
    momentum moving vertically upwards from below the plane, and disc stars with slightly
    lower angular momentum moving preferentially downwards; (ii) we resolve the kinematic
    substructure (diagonal ridges) in the outer parts of the disc for the first time;
    (iii) the red sequence that has been associated with the proto-Galactic disc that
    was present at the time of the merger with Gaia-Enceladus-Sausage is currently
    radially concentrated up to around 14 kpc, while the blue sequence that has been
    associated with debris of the satellite extends beyond that; (iv) there are density
    structures in the outer disc, both above and below the plane, most probably related
    to Monoceros, the Anticentre Stream, and TriAnd, for which the Gaia data allow
    an exhaustive selection of candidate member stars and dynamical study; and (v)
    the open clusters Berkeley 29 and Saurer 1, despite being located at large distances
    from the Galactic centre, are on nearly circular disc-like orbits. <BR /> Conclusions:
    Even with our simple preliminary exploration of the Gaia EDR3, we demonstrate
    how, once again, these data from the European Space Agency are crucial for our
    understanding of the different pieces of our Galaxy and their connection to its
    global structure and history. <P />Movie is available at <A href="https://www.aanda.org/10.1051/0004-6361/202039714/olm">https://www.aanda.org</A>'

  title: Gaia Early Data Release 3. The Galactic anticentre
  url: null
  volume: '649'
  year: 2021
- abstract: 'Context. This work is part of the Gaia Data Processing and Analysis Consortium
    papers published with the Gaia Early Data Release 3 (EDR3). It is one of the demonstration
    papers aiming to highlight the improvements and quality of the newly published
    data by applying them to a scientific case. <BR /> Aims: We use the Gaia EDR3
    data to study the structure and kinematics of the Magellanic Clouds. The large
    distance to the Clouds is a challenge for the Gaia astrometry. The Clouds lie
    at the very limits of the usability of the Gaia data, which makes the Clouds an
    excellent case study for evaluating the quality and properties of the Gaia data.
    <BR /> Methods: The basis of our work are two samples selected to provide a representation
    as clean as possible of the stars of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and the
    Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). The selection used criteria based on position, parallax,
    and proper motions to remove foreground contamination from the Milky Way, and
    allowed the separation of the stars of both Clouds. From these two samples we
    defined a series of subsamples based on cuts in the colour-magnitude diagram;
    these subsamples were used to select stars in a common evolutionary phase and
    can also be used as approximate proxies of a selection by age. <BR /> Results:
    We compared the Gaia Data Release 2 and Gaia EDR3 performances in the study of
    the Magellanic Clouds and show the clear improvements in precision and accuracy
    in the new release. We also show that the systematics still present in the data
    make the determination of the 3D geometry of the LMC a difficult endeavour; this
    is at the very limit of the usefulness of the Gaia EDR3 astrometry, but it may
    become feasible with the use of additional external data. We derive radial and
    tangential velocity maps and global profiles for the LMC for the several subsamples
    we defined. To our knowledge, this is the first time that the two planar components
    of the ordered and random motions are derived for multiple stellar evolutionary
    phases in a galactic disc outside the Milky Way, showing the differences between
    younger and older phases. We also analyse the spatial structure and motions in
    the central region, the bar, and the disc, providing new insightsinto features
    and kinematics. Finally, we show that the Gaia EDR3 data allows clearly resolving
    the Magellanic Bridge, and we trace the density and velocity flow of the stars
    from the SMC towards the LMC not only globally, but also separately for young
    and evolved populations. This allows us to confirm an evolved population in the
    Bridge that is slightly shift from the younger population. Additionally, we were
    able to study the outskirts of both Magellanic Clouds, in which we detected some
    well-known features and indications of new ones. <P />Velocity profiles are only
    available at the CDS via anonymous ftp to <A href="http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr">cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr</A>

- abstract: 'We produce a clean and well characterised catalogue of nearby objects
    within 100pc of the Sun from the Gaia early third data release. We characterise
    the catalogue using the full data release, and comparisons to other catalogues
    in literature and simulations. We started with a sample of objects with a measured
    parallax of 8mas. For all candidates we calculate a distance probability function
    using Bayesian procedures and mock catalogues for the prediction of the priors.
    For each entry using a random forest classifier we attempt to remove sources with
    spurious astrometric solutions. <P />&gt;From this paper we provide the following
    data files: <P />table1c.dat (Table1<SUB>GCNS</SUB>cat): Any object with a non-zero
    probability of being within 100 pc and not indicated as a spurious astrometric
    solutions. We have also included external photometric and radial velocity data,
    the probability of reliable astrometry, probability to be a white dwarf, the distance
    1st, 16th, 50th and 84th percentiles, the positions and velocities in a galactic
    reference frame. For questions please email richard.smart(at)inaf.it. <P />table1r.dat
    (Table1<SUB>GCNS</SUB>reject): All other entries from the 8mas sample that were
    rejected as having a zero probability of being inside 100pc or indicated as a
    spurious astrometric solution. This table has the same format and columns as GCNS_cat.dat.
    <P />progwd.dat (ProbWDlt05_ProbGFgt05): A catalogue of 45 sources with low probability
    of being a WD in this work (PWD&lt;0.5), but having larger probabilities in Gentile-Fusillo
    et al (2019MNRAS.482.4570G, cat. J/MNRAS/482/4570) (PGF&gt;0.5). For questions
    please email carrasco(at)fqa.ub.edu. <P />table3.dat (Table3_ResolvedStellarSystems):
    Resolved binary candidates in the GCNS catalogue as discussed in the section on
    stellar multiplicity: resolved systems. For questions please email ummi.abbas(at)inaf.it
    or alessandro.sozzetti(at)inaf.it. <P />maglim.dat (maglim<SUB>hpx5</SUB>percentile):
    The magnitude percentiles for level 5 healpixels used in the luminosity function
    determinations. For questions please email rybizki(at)mpia.de. <P />distpdf.dat
    (distance_PDF): The full distance probability density function calculated in section
    2 and used throughout the paper. For questions please email rybizki(at)mpia.de.
    <P />missing.dat (missing_10mas): A list of 1258 objects with published parallaxes
    greater than 10mas that are not or have no parallax in EDR3. For questions please
    email celine.reyle(at)obs-besancon.fr. <P />hyacomb.dat (Hyades_ComaBer): A list
    of 920+212 probable Hyades and ComaBer members in the GCNS sample. For questions
    please email daniel.michalik(at)esa.int or jos.de.bruijne(at)esa.int. <P />(8

- abstract: The 4MOST instrument is a multi-object spectrograph that will address
    Galactic and extragalactic science cases simultaneously by observing targets from
    a large number of different surveys within each science exposure. This parallel
    mode of operation and the survey nature of 4MOST require some distinct 4MOST-
    specific operational features within the overall operations model of ESO. The
    main feature is that the 4MOST Consortium will deliver, not only the instrument,
    but also contractual services to the user community, which is why 4MOST is also
    described as a facility. This white paper concentrates on information particularly
    useful to answering the forthcoming Call for Letters of Intent.

- abstract: "We introduce the 4-metre Multi-Object Spectroscopic Telescope (4MOST),\
    \ a new high-multiplex, wide-field spectroscopic survey facility under development\
    \ for the four-metre-class Visible and Infrared Survey Telescope for Astronomy\
    \ (VISTA) at Paranal. Its key specifications are: a large field of view (FoV)\
    \ of 4.2 square degrees and a high multiplex capability, with 1624 fibres feeding\
    \ two low-resolution spectrographs (R = \u03BB/\u0394\u03BB 6500), and 812 fibres\
    \ transferring light to the high-resolution spectrograph (R 20 000). After a description\
    \ of the instrument and its expected performance, a short overview is given of\
    \ its operational scheme and planned 4MOST Consortium science; these aspects are\
    \ covered in more detail in other articles in this edition of The Messenger. Finally,\
    \ the processes, schedules, and policies concerning the selection of ESO Community\
    \ Surveys are presented, commencing with a singular opportunity to submit Letters\
    \ of Intent for Public Surveys during the first five years of 4MOST operations."

- abstract: The mechanisms of the formation and evolution of the Milky Way are encoded
    in the orbits, chemistry and ages of its stars. With the 4MOST MIlky way Disk
    And BuLgE Low-Resolution Survey (4MIDABLE-LR) we aim to study kinematic and chemical
    substructures in the Milky Way disc and bulge region with samples of unprecedented
    size out to larger distances and greater precision than conceivable with Gaia
    alone or any other ongoing or planned survey. Gaia gives us the unique opportunity
    for target selection based almost entirely on parallax and magnitude range, hence
    increasing the efficiency in sampling larger Milky Way volumes with well-defined
    and effective selection functions.

- abstract: "Context. The ESA Gaia mission provides a unique time-domain survey for\
    \ more than 1.6 billion sources with G \u2272 21 mag. <BR /> Aims: We showcase\
    \ stellar variability in the Galactic colour-absolute magnitude diagram (CaMD).\
    \ We focus on pulsating, eruptive, and cataclysmic variables, as well as on stars\
    \ that exhibit variability that is due to rotation and eclipses. <BR /> Methods:\
    \ We describe the locations of variable star classes, variable object fractions,\
    \ and typical variability amplitudes throughout the CaMD and show how variability-related\
    \ changes in colour and brightness induce \"motions\". To do this, we use 22 months\
    \ of calibrated photometric, spectro-photometric, and astrometric Gaia data of\
    \ stars with a significant parallax. To ensure that a large variety of variable\
    \ star classes populate the CaMD, we crossmatched Gaia sources with known variable\
    \ stars. We also used the statistics and variability detection modules of the\
    \ Gaia variability pipeline. Corrections for interstellar extinction are not implemented\
    \ in this article. <BR /> Results: Gaia enables the first investigation of Galactic\
    \ variable star populations in the CaMD on a similar, if not larger, scale as\
    \ was previously done in the Magellanic Clouds. Although the observed colours\
    \ are not corrected for reddening, distinct regions are visible in which variable\
    \ stars occur. We determine variable star fractions to within the current detection\
    \ thresholds of Gaia. Finally, we report the most complete description of variability-induced\
    \ motion within the CaMD to date. <BR /> Conclusions: Gaia enables novel insights\
    \ into variability phenomena for an unprecedented number of stars, which will\
    \ benefit the understanding of stellar astrophysics. The CaMD of Galactic variable\
    \ stars provides crucial information on physical origins of variability in a way\
    \ that has previously only been accessible for Galactic star clusters or external\
    \ galaxies. Future Gaia data releases will enable significant improvements over\
    \ this preview by providing longer time series, more accurate astrometry, and\
    \ additional data types (time series BP and RP spectra, RVS spectra, and radial\
    \ velocities), all for much larger samples of stars. <P />A movie associated to\
    \ Fig. 11 is available at <A href=\"https://www.aanda.org/10.1051/0004-6361/201833304/olm\"\

  title: Gaia Data Release 2. Variable stars in the colour-absolute magnitude diagram
  url: null
  volume: '623'
  year: 2019
- abstract: "Context. The second release of Gaia data (Gaia DR2) contains the astrometric\
    \ parameters for more than half a million quasars. This set defines a kinematically\
    \ non-rotating reference frame in the optical domain. A subset of these quasars\
    \ have accurate VLBI positions that allow the axes of the reference frame to be\
    \ aligned with the International Celestial Reference System (ICRF) radio frame.\
    \ <BR /> Aims: We describe the astrometric and photometric properties of the quasars\
    \ that were selected to represent the celestial reference frame of Gaia DR2 (Gaia-CRF2),\
    \ and to compare the optical and radio positions for sources with accurate VLBI\
    \ positions. <BR /> Methods: Descriptive statistics are used to characterise the\
    \ overall properties of the quasar sample. Residual rotation and orientation errors\
    \ and large-scale systematics are quantified by means of expansions in vector\
    \ spherical harmonics. Positional differences are calculated relative to a prototype\
    \ version of the forthcoming ICRF3. <BR /> Results: Gaia-CRF2 consists of the\
    \ positions of a sample of 556 869 sources in Gaia DR2, obtained from a positional\
    \ cross-match with the ICRF3-prototype and AllWISE AGN catalogues. The sample\
    \ constitutes a clean, dense, and homogeneous set of extragalactic point sources\
    \ in the magnitude range G \u2243 16 to 21 mag with accurately known optical positions.\
    \ The median positional uncertainty is 0.12 mas for G &lt; 18 mag and 0.5 mas\
    \ at G = mag. Large-scale systematics are estimated to be in the range 20 to 30\
    \ \u03BCas. The accuracy claims are supported by the parallaxes and proper motions\
    \ of the quasars in Gaia DR2. The optical positions for a subset of 2820 sources\
    \ in common with the ICRF3-prototype show very good overall agreement with the\
    \ radio positions, but several tens of sources have significantly discrepant positions.\
    \ <BR /> Conclusions: Based on less than 40% of the data expected from the nominal\
    \ Gaia mission, Gaia-CRF2 is the first realisation of a non-rotating global optical\
    \ reference frame that meets the ICRS prescriptions, meaning that it is built\
    \ only on extragalactic sources. Its accuracy matches the current radio frame\
    \ of the ICRF, but the density of sources in all parts of the sky is much higher,\
    \ except along the Galactic equator."

- abstract: The files contains lists of possible members of each of the objects (75
    globular clusters, 9 dwarf spheroidal galaxies, the Bootes I UFD, the LMC and
    SMC). The stars in these lists have been selected and used to determine the astrometric
    parameters of the corresponding objects following either the procedures described
    in Sec. 2.1 (for the clusters and dwarfs) or in Sec. 2.2 (for the LMC and SMC).
    The first column is the "source_id" as given by Gaia, the ra and declination of
    the star in degrees, and its G-band magnitude (known as "phot<SUB>g</SUB>mean_mag"
    in the Gaia archive). <P />(2 data files).

- abstract: 'Context. The Gaia spacecraft of the European Space Agency (ESA) has been
    securing observations of solar system objects (SSOs) since the beginning of its
    operations. Data Release 2 (DR2) contains the observations of a selected sample
    of 14,099 SSOs. These asteroids have been already identified and have been numbered
    by the Minor Planet Center repository. Positions are provided for each Gaia observation
    at CCD level. As additional information, complementary to astrometry, the apparent
    brightness of SSOs in the unfiltered G band is also provided for selected observations.
    <BR /> Aims: We explain the processing of SSO data, and describe the criteria
    we used to select the sample published in Gaia DR2. We then explore the data set
    to assess its quality. <BR /> Methods: To exploit the main data product for the
    solar system in Gaia DR2, which is the epoch astrometry of asteroids, it is necessary
    to take into account the unusual properties of the uncertainty, as the position
    information is nearly one-dimensional. When this aspect is handled appropriately,
    an orbit fit can be obtained with post-fit residuals that are overall consistent
    with the a-priori error model that was used to define individual values of the
    astrometric uncertainty. The role of both random and systematic errors is described.
    The distribution of residuals allowed us to identify possible contaminants in
    the data set (such as stars). Photometry in the G band was compared to computed
    values from reference asteroid shapes and to the flux registered at the corresponding
    epochs by the red and blue photometers (RP and BP). <BR /> Results: The overall
    astrometric performance is close to the expectations, with an optimal range of
    brightness G 12 - 17. In this range, the typical transit-level accuracy is well
    below 1 mas. For fainter asteroids, the growing photon noise deteriorates the
    performance. Asteroids brighter than G 12 are affected by a lower performance
    of the processing of their signals. The dramatic improvement brought by Gaia DR2
    astrometry of SSOs is demonstrated by comparisons to the archive data and by preliminary
    tests on the detection of subtle non-gravitational effects.'

  title: Gaia Data Release 2. Observations of solar system objects
  url: null
  volume: '616'
  year: 2018
- abstract: 'Context. Gaia Data Release 2 provides high-precision astrometry and three-band
    photometry for about 1.3 billion sources over the full sky. The precision, accuracy,
    and homogeneity of both astrometry and photometry are unprecedented. <BR /> Aims:
    We highlight the power of the Gaia DR2 in studying many fine structures of the
    Hertzsprung-Russell diagram (HRD). Gaia allows us to present many different HRDs,
    depending in particular on stellar population selections. We do not aim here for
    completeness in terms of types of stars or stellar evolutionary aspects. Instead,
    we have chosen several illustrative examples. <BR /> Methods: We describe some
    of the selections that can be made in Gaia DR2 to highlight the main structures
    of the Gaia HRDs. We select both field and cluster (open and globular) stars,
    compare the observations with previous classifications and with stellar evolutionary
    tracks, and we present variations of the Gaia HRD with age, metallicity, and kinematics.
    Late stages of stellar evolution such as hot subdwarfs, post-AGB stars, planetary
    nebulae, and white dwarfs are also analysed, as well as low-mass brown dwarf objects.
    <BR /> Results: The Gaia HRDs are unprecedented in both precision and coverage
    of the various Milky Way stellar populations and stellar evolutionary phases.
    Many fine structures of the HRDs are presented. The clear split of the white dwarf
    sequence into hydrogen and helium white dwarfs is presented for the first time
    in an HRD. The relation between kinematics and the HRD is nicely illustrated.
    Two different populations in a classical kinematic selection of the halo are unambiguously
    identified in the HRD. Membership and mean parameters for a selected list of open
    clusters are provided. They allow drawing very detailed cluster sequences, highlighting
    fine structures, and providing extremely precise empirical isochrones that will
    lead to more insight in stellar physics. <BR /> Conclusions: Gaia DR2 demonstrates
    the potential of combining precise astrometry and photometry for large samples
    for studies in stellar evolution and stellar population and opens an entire new
    area for HRD-based studies. <P />The full Table A.1 is only available at the CDS

  title: Gaia Data Release 2. Observational Hertzsprung-Russell diagrams
  url: null
  volume: '616'
  year: 2018
- abstract: "Note to the Readers: Following the publication of the <A href=\"https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2020/05/aa32698e-18/aa32698e-18.html\"\
    >corrigendum</A>, the article was corrected on 15 May 2020. <P />Context. <BR\
    \ /> Aims: The goal of this paper is to demonstrate the outstanding quality of\
    \ the second data release of the Gaia mission and its power for constraining many\
    \ different aspects of the dynamics of the satellites of the Milky Way. We focus\
    \ here on determining the proper motions of 75 Galactic globular clusters, nine\
    \ dwarf spheroidal galaxies, one ultra-faint system, and the Large and Small Magellanic\
    \ Clouds. <BR /> Methods: Using data extracted from the Gaia archive, we derived\
    \ the proper motions and parallaxes for these systems, as well as their uncertainties.\
    \ We demonstrate that the errors, statistical and systematic, are relatively well\
    \ understood. We integrated the orbits of these objects in three different Galactic\
    \ potentials, and characterised their properties. We present the derived proper\
    \ motions, space velocities, and characteristic orbital parameters in various\
    \ tables to facilitate their use by the astronomical community. <BR /> Results:\
    \ Our limited and straightforward analyses have allowed us for example to (i)\
    \ determine absolute and very precise proper motions for globular clusters; (ii)\
    \ detect clear rotation signatures in the proper motions of at least five globular\
    \ clusters; (iii) show that the satellites of the Milky Way are all on high-inclination\
    \ orbits, but that they do not share a single plane of motion; (iv) derive a lower\
    \ limit for the mass of the Milky Way of 9.1<SUB>-2.6</SUB><SUP>+6.2</SUP> \xD7\
    \ 10<SUP>11</SUP> M<SUB>\u2299</SUB> based on the assumption that the Leo I dwarf\
    \ spheroidal is bound; (v) derive a rotation curve for the Large Magellanic Cloud\
    \ based solely on proper motions that is competitive with line-of-sight velocity\
    \ curves, now using many orders of magnitude more sources; and (vi) unveil the\
    \ dynamical effect of the bar on the motions of stars in the Large Magellanic\
    \ Cloud. <BR /> Conclusions: All these results highlight the incredible power\
    \ of the Gaia astrometric mission, and in particular of its second data release.\

  title: Gaia Data Release 2. Kinematics of globular clusters and dwarf galaxies around
    the Milky Way
  url: null
  volume: '616'
  year: 2018
- abstract: "Context. The second Gaia data release (Gaia DR2) contains high-precision\
    \ positions, parallaxes, and proper motions for 1.3 billion sources as well as\
    \ line-of-sight velocities for 7.2 million stars brighter than G<SUB>RVS</SUB>\
    \ = 12 mag. Both samples provide a full sky coverage. <BR /> Aims: To illustrate\
    \ the potential of Gaia DR2, we provide a first look at the kinematics of the\
    \ Milky Way disc, within a radius of several kiloparsecs around the Sun. <BR />\
    \ Methods: We benefit for the first time from a sample of 6.4 million F-G-K stars\
    \ with full 6D phase-space coordinates, precise parallaxes (\u03C3<SUB>\u03D6\
    </SUB>/\u03D6 \u2264 20%), and precise Galactic cylindrical velocities (median\
    \ uncertainties of 0.9-1.4 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> and 20% of the stars with uncertainties\
    \ smaller than 1 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> on all three components). From this sample,\
    \ we extracted a sub-sample of 3.2 million giant stars to map the velocity field\
    \ of the Galactic disc from 5 kpc to 13 kpc from the Galactic centre and up to\
    \ 2 kpc above and below the plane. We also study the distribution of 0.3 million\
    \ solar neighbourhood stars (r &lt; 200 pc), with median velocity uncertainties\
    \ of 0.4 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>, in velocity space and use the full sample to examine\
    \ how the over-densities evolve in more distant regions. <BR /> Results: Gaia\
    \ DR2 allows us to draw 3D maps of the Galactocentric median velocities and velocity\
    \ dispersions with unprecedented accuracy, precision, and spatial resolution.\
    \ The maps show the complexity and richness of the velocity field of the galactic\
    \ disc. We observe streaming motions in all the components of the velocities as\
    \ well as patterns in the velocity dispersions. For example, we confirm the previously\
    \ reported negative and positive galactocentric radial velocity gradients in the\
    \ inner and outer disc, respectively. Here, we see them as part of a non-axisymmetric\
    \ kinematic oscillation, and we map its azimuthal and vertical behaviour. We also\
    \ witness a new global arrangement of stars in the velocity plane of the solar\
    \ neighbourhood and in distant regions in which stars are organised in thin substructures\
    \ with the shape of circular arches that are oriented approximately along the\
    \ horizontal direction in the U - V plane. Moreover, in distant regions, we see\
    \ variations in the velocity substructures more clearly than ever before, in particular,\
    \ variations in the velocity of the Hercules stream. <BR /> Conclusions: Gaia\
    \ DR2 provides the largest existing full 6D phase-space coordinates catalogue.\
    \ It also vastly increases the number of available distances and transverse velocities\
    \ with respect to Gaia DR1. Gaia DR2 offers a great wealth of information on the\
    \ Milky Way and reveals clear non-axisymmetric kinematic signatures within the\
    \ Galactic disc, for instance. It is now up to the astronomical community to explore\
    \ its full potential."

  title: Gaia Data Release 2. Mapping the Milky Way disc kinematics
  url: null
  volume: '616'
  year: 2018
- abstract: 'Context. We present the second Gaia data release, Gaia DR2, consisting
    of astrometry, photometry, radial velocities, and information on astrophysical
    parameters and variability, for sources brighter than magnitude 21. In addition
    epoch astrometry and photometry are provided for a modest sample of minor planets
    in the solar system. <BR /> Aims: A summary of the contents of Gaia DR2 is presented,
    accompanied by a discussion on the differences with respect to Gaia DR1 and an
    overview of the main limitations which are still present in the survey. Recommendations
    are made on the responsible use of Gaia DR2 results. <BR /> Methods: The raw data
    collected with the Gaia instruments during the first 22 months of the mission
    have been processed by the Gaia Data Processing and Analysis Consortium (DPAC)
    and turned into this second data release, which represents a major advance with
    respect to Gaia DR1 in terms of completeness, performance, and richness of the
    data products. <BR /> Results: Gaia DR2 contains celestial positions and the apparent
    brightness in G for approximately 1.7 billion sources. For 1.3 billion of those
    sources, parallaxes and proper motions are in addition available. The sample of
    sources for which variability information is provided is expanded to 0.5 million
    stars. This data release contains four new elements: broad-band colour information
    in the form of the apparent brightness in the G<SUB>BP</SUB> (330-680 nm) and
    G<SUB>RP</SUB> (630-1050 nm) bands is available for 1.4 billion sources; median
    radial velocities for some 7 million sources are presented; for between 77 and
    161 million sources estimates are provided of the stellar effective temperature,
    extinction, reddening, and radius and luminosity; and for a pre-selected list
    of 14 000 minor planets in the solar system epoch astrometry and photometry are
    presented. Finally, Gaia DR2 also represents a new materialisation of the celestial
    reference frame in the optical, the Gaia-CRF2, which is the first optical reference
    frame based solely on extragalactic sources. There are notable changes in the
    photometric system and the catalogue source list with respect to Gaia DR1, and
    we stress the need to consider the two data releases as independent. <BR /> Conclusions:
    Gaia DR2 represents a major achievement for the Gaia mission, delivering on the
    long standing promise to provide parallaxes and proper motions for over 1 billion
    stars, and representing a first step in the availability of complementary radial
    velocity and source astrophysical information for a sample of stars in the Gaia
    survey which covers a very substantial fraction of the volume of our galaxy.'

  title: Gaia Data Release 2. Summary of the contents and survey properties
  url: null
  volume: '616'
  year: 2018
- abstract: "Context. Parallaxes for 331 classical Cepheids, 31 Type II Cepheids,\
    \ and 364 RR Lyrae stars in common between Gaia and the HIPPARCOS and Tycho-2\
    \ catalogues are published in Gaia Data Release 1 (DR1) as part of the Tycho-Gaia\
    \ Astrometric Solution (TGAS). <BR /> Aims: In order to test these first parallax\
    \ measurements of the primary standard candles of the cosmological distance ladder,\
    \ which involve astrometry collected by Gaia during the initial 14 months of science\
    \ operation, we compared them with literature estimates and derived new period-luminosity\
    \ (PL), period-Wesenheit (PW) relations for classical and Type II Cepheids and\
    \ infrared PL, PL-metallicity (PLZ), and optical luminosity-metallicity (M<SUB>V</SUB>-[Fe/H])\
    \ relations for the RR Lyrae stars, with zero points based on TGAS. <BR /> Methods:\
    \ Classical Cepheids were carefully selected in order to discard known or suspected\
    \ binary systems. The final sample comprises 102 fundamental mode pulsators with\
    \ periods ranging from 1.68 to 51.66 days (of which 33 with \u03C3<SUB>\u03D6\
    </SUB>/\u03D6&lt; 0.5). The Type II Cepheids include a total of 26 W Virginis\
    \ and BL Herculis stars spanning the period range from 1.16 to 30.00 days (of\
    \ which only 7 with \u03C3<SUB>\u03D6</SUB>/\u03D6&lt; 0.5). The RR Lyrae stars\
    \ include 200 sources with pulsation period ranging from 0.27 to 0.80 days (of\
    \ which 112 with \u03C3<SUB>\u03D6</SUB>/\u03D6&lt; 0.5). The new relations were\
    \ computed using multi-band (V,I,J,K<SUB>s</SUB>) photometry and spectroscopic\
    \ metal abundances available in the literature, and by applying three alternative\
    \ approaches: (i) linear least-squares fitting of the absolute magnitudes inferred\
    \ from direct transformation of the TGAS parallaxes; (ii) adopting astrometry-based\
    \ luminosities; and (iii) using a Bayesian fitting approach. The last two methods\
    \ work in parallax space where parallaxes are used directly, thus maintaining\
    \ symmetrical errors and allowing negative parallaxes to be used. The TGAS-based\
    \ PL,PW,PLZ, and M<SUB>V</SUB>- [Fe/H] relations are discussed by comparing the\
    \ distance to the Large Magellanic Cloud provided by different types of pulsating\
    \ stars and alternative fitting methods. <BR /> Results: Good agreement is found\
    \ from direct comparison of the parallaxes of RR Lyrae stars for which both TGAS\
    \ and HST measurements are available. Similarly, very good agreement is found\
    \ between the TGAS values and the parallaxes inferred from the absolute magnitudes\
    \ of Cepheids and RR Lyrae stars analysed with the Baade-Wesselink method. TGAS\
    \ values also compare favourably with the parallaxes inferred by theoretical model\
    \ fitting of the multi-band light curves for two of the three classical Cepheids\
    \ and one RR Lyrae star, which were analysed with this technique in our samples.\
    \ The K-band PL relations show the significant improvement of the TGAS parallaxes\
    \ for Cepheids and RR Lyrae stars with respect to the HIPPARCOS measurements.\
    \ This is particularly true for the RR Lyrae stars for which improvement in quality\
    \ and statistics is impressive. <BR /> Conclusions: TGAS parallaxes bring a significant\
    \ added value to the previous HIPPARCOS estimates. The relations presented in\
    \ this paper represent the first Gaia-calibrated relations and form a work-in-progress\
    \ milestone report in the wait for Gaia-only parallaxes of which a first solution\
    \ will become available with Gaia Data Release 2 (DR2) in 2018. <P />Full Tables\

- abstract: 'Context. The first Gaia Data Release contains the Tycho-Gaia Astrometric
    Solution (TGAS). This is a subset of about 2 million stars for which, besides
    the position and photometry, the proper motion and parallax are calculated using
    HIPPARCOS and Tycho-2 positions in 1991.25 as prior information. <BR /> Aims:
    We investigate the scientific potential and limitations of the TGAS component
    by means of the astrometric data for open clusters. <BR /> Methods: Mean cluster
    parallax and proper motion values are derived taking into account the error correlations
    within the astrometric solutions for individual stars, an estimate of the internal
    velocity dispersion in the cluster, and, where relevant, the effects of the depth
    of the cluster along the line of sight. Internal consistency of the TGAS data
    is assessed. <BR /> Results: Values given for standard uncertainties are still
    inaccurate and may lead to unrealistic unit-weight standard deviations of least
    squares solutions for cluster parameters. Reconstructed mean cluster parallax
    and proper motion values are generally in very good agreement with earlier HIPPARCOS-based
    determination, although the Gaia mean parallax for the Pleiades is a significant
    exception. We have no current explanation for that discrepancy. Most clusters
    are observed to extend to nearly 15 pc from the cluster centre, and it will be
    up to future Gaia releases to establish whether those potential cluster-member
    stars are still dynamically bound to the clusters. <BR /> Conclusions: The Gaia
    DR1 provides the means to examine open clusters far beyond their more easily visible
    cores, and can provide membership assessments based on proper motions and parallaxes.
    A combined HR diagram shows the same features as observed before using the HIPPARCOS
    data, with clearly increased luminosities for older A and F dwarfs. <P />Tables
    D.1 to D.19 are also available at the CDS via anonymous ftp to <A href="http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr">http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr</A>

  title: 'Gaia Data Release 1. Open cluster astrometry: performance, limitations,
    and future prospects'
  url: null
  volume: '601'
  year: 2017
- abstract: Gaia is a cornerstone mission in the science programme of the EuropeanSpace
    Agency (ESA). The spacecraft construction was approved in 2006, following a study
    in which the original interferometric concept was changed to a direct-imaging
    approach. Both the spacecraft and the payload were built by European industry.
    The involvement of the scientific community focusses on data processing for which
    the international Gaia Data Processing and Analysis Consortium (DPAC) was selected
    in 2007. Gaia was launched on 19 December 2013 and arrived at its operating point,
    the second Lagrange point of the Sun-Earth-Moon system, a few weeks later. The
    commissioning of the spacecraft and payload was completed on 19 July 2014. The
    nominal five-year mission started with four weeks of special, ecliptic-pole scanning
    and subsequently transferred into full-sky scanning mode. We recall the scientific
    goals of Gaia and give a description of the as-built spacecraft that is currently
    (mid-2016) being operated to achieve these goals. We pay special attention to
    the payload module, the performance of which is closely related to the scientific
    performance of the mission. We provide a summary of the commissioning activities
    and findings, followed by a description of the routine operational mode. We summarise
    scientific performance estimates on the basis of in-orbit operations. Several
    intermediate Gaia data releases are planned and the data can be retrieved from
    the Gaia Archive, which is available through the Gaia home page. <P /><A href="http://www.cosmos.esa.int/gaia">http://www.cosmos.esa.int/gaia</A>

  title: The Gaia mission
  url: null
  volume: '595'
  year: 2016
- abstract: 'Context. At about 1000 days after the launch of Gaia we present the first
    Gaia data release, Gaia DR1, consisting of astrometry and photometry for over
    1 billion sources brighter than magnitude 20.7. <BR /> Aims: A summary of Gaia
    DR1 is presented along with illustrations of the scientific quality of the data,
    followed by a discussion of the limitations due to the preliminary nature of this
    release. <BR /> Methods: The raw data collected by Gaia during the first 14 months
    of the mission have been processed by the Gaia Data Processing and Analysis Consortium
    (DPAC) and turned into an astrometric and photometric catalogue. <BR /> Results:
    Gaia DR1 consists of three components: a primary astrometric data set which contains
    the positions, parallaxes, and mean proper motions for about 2 million of the
    brightest stars in common with the Hipparcos and Tycho-2 catalogues - a realisation
    of the Tycho-Gaia Astrometric Solution (TGAS) - and a secondary astrometric data
    set containing the positions for an additional 1.1 billion sources. The second
    component is the photometric data set, consisting of mean G-band magnitudes for
    all sources. The G-band light curves and the characteristics of 3000 Cepheid and
    RR Lyrae stars, observed at high cadence around the south ecliptic pole, form
    the third component. For the primary astrometric data set the typical uncertainty
    is about 0.3 mas for the positions and parallaxes, and about 1 mas yr<SUP>-1</SUP>
    for the proper motions. A systematic component of 0.3 mas should be added to the
    parallax uncertainties. For the subset of 94 000 Hipparcos stars in the primary
    data set, the proper motions are much more precise at about 0.06 mas yr<SUP>-1</SUP>.
    For the secondary astrometric data set, the typical uncertainty of the positions
    is 10 mas. The median uncertainties on the mean G-band magnitudes range from the
    mmag level to 0.03 mag over the magnitude range 5 to 20.7. <BR /> Conclusions:
    Gaia DR1 is an important milestone ahead of the next Gaia data release, which
    will feature five-parameter astrometry for all sources. Extensive validation shows
    that Gaia DR1 represents a major advance in the mapping of the heavens and the
    availability of basic stellar data that underpin observational astrophysics. Nevertheless,
    the very preliminary nature of this first Gaia data release does lead to a number
    of important limitations to the data quality which should be carefully considered
    before drawing conclusions from the data.'

    can also be used as estimates of the distance modulus. Geometric distances use
    only the EDR3 parallaxes. Photogeometric distances additionally use the G magnitude
    and BP-RP colour from EDR3. Both types of estimate involve directiondependent
    priors constructed from a sophisticated model of the 3D distribution, colours,
    and magnitudes of stars in the Galaxy as seen by Gaia, i.e. accommodating both
    interstellar extinction and a Gaia selection function. Tests on mock data, but
    moreover validation against independent estimates and open clusters, suggest our
    estimates are reliable out to several kpc. For faint or more distant stars the
    prior will often dominate the estimates. <P />(1 data file).

- abstract: "Observational tests of stellar and Galactic chemical evolution call for\
    \ the joint knowledge of a star's physical parameters, detailed element abundances,\
    \ and precise age. For cool main-sequence (MS) stars the abundances of many elements\
    \ can be measured from spectroscopy, but ages are very hard to determine. The\
    \ situation is different if the MS star has a white dwarf (WD) companion and a\
    \ known distance, as the age of such a binary system can then be determined precisely\
    \ from the photometric properties of the cooling WD. As a pilot study for obtaining\
    \ precise age determinations of field MS stars, we identify nearly 100 candidates\
    \ for such wide binary systems: a faint WD whose Gaia-PS1-SDSS (GPS1) proper motion\
    \ (Tian+ 2017, I/343) matches that of a brighter MS star in Gaia/TGAS (Gaia Collaboration\
    \ 2016, I/337) with a good parallax (\u03C3<SUB>{rho}</SUB>/{rho}=&lt;0.05). We\
    \ model the WD's multi-band photometry with the BASE-9 code using this precise\
    \ distance (assumed to be common for the pair) and infer ages for each binary\
    \ system. The resulting age estimates are precise to =&lt;10% (=&lt;20%) for 42\
    \ (67) MS-WD systems. Our analysis more than doubles the number of MS-WD systems\
    \ with precise distances known to date, and it boosts the number of such systems\
    \ with precise age determination by an order of magnitude. With the advent of\
    \ the Gaia DR2 (Gaia Collaboration, 2018, I/345) data, this approach will be applicable\
    \ to a far larger sample, providing ages for many MS stars (that can yield detailed\
    \ abundances for over 20 elements), especially in the age range of 2-8Gyr, where\
    \ there are only few known star clusters. <P />(1 data file)."

- abstract: Gaia DR2 offers us a first glimpse at the most detailed view of the dynamics
    of field star populations in our Galaxy. However; knowledge of the stellar properties
    of these populations is critical to understanding fully the Milky-Way's formation
    and evolution. We present an all-sky uniformly derived catalog of stellar astrophysical
    parameters for hundreds of millions of stars implementing our data processing
    of the next Gaia data release. <P />As the DR3 BP/RP spectra are not yet available;
    we combined measurements of Gaia integrated photometry with GALEX; 2MASS; and
    WISE photometry; where available as an alternative to cover a large wavelength
    range. We obtain the posterior probability distribution of stellar properties
    such as age; mass; temperature; bolometric luminosity; distance; and dust extinction
    by fitting these sets of SEDs with evolutionary models; taking advantage of the
    GDR2 parallaxes to uniquely link atmospheric parameters to absolute bolometric
    luminosities. <P />This catalog bridges the gap between the content of GDR2 and
    the future GDR3 which will provide stellar parameters using Gaia data alone. This
    represents a key first step to anchor all current and future spectroscopic surveys
    to a common ground and provide us with the most comprehensive view of our Galaxy.

- abstract: 'The tables give the perihelion (closest approach) parameters of stars
    in the Gaia-DR2 catalogue which are found by numerical integration through a Galactic
    potential to approach within 10pc of the Sun. These parameters are the time (relative
    to the Gaia measurement epoch), heliocentric distance, and heliocentric speed
    of the star at perihelion. Uncertainties in these have been calculated by a Monte
    Carlo sampling of the data to give the posterior probability density function
    (PDF) over the parameters. For each parameter, three summary values of this PDF
    are reported: the median, the 5% lower bound, the 95% upper bound. The latter
    two give a 90% confidence interval. The table also reports the measured parallax,
    proper motion, radial velocity (plus uncertainties), and mass of the stars. A
    second table reports additional data, in particular astrometric quality metrics,
    from the Gaia-DR2 catalogue. Tables 2 and 3 in the article list the first 31 lines
    of these data tables (stars with median perihelion distances below 1pc). Stars
    with problematic data have not been removed, so some encounters are not reliable.

- abstract: We present a model to map the 3D distribution of dust in the Milky Way.
    Although dust is just a tiny fraction of what comprises the Galaxy, it plays an
    important role in various processes. In recent years various maps of dust extinction
    have been produced, but we still lack a good knowledge of the dust distribution.
    Our presented approach leverages line-of-sight extinctions towards stars in the
    Galaxy at measured distances. Since extinction is proportional to the integral
    of the dust density towards a given star, it is possible to reconstruct the 3D
    distribution of dust by combining many lines-of-sight in a model accounting for
    the spatial correlation of the dust. Such a technique can be used to infer the
    most probable 3D distribution of dust in the Galaxy even in regions which have

    not show the ``fingers of God'' effect. Furthermore, we show that expected high
    precision measurements of distances and extinctions offer the possibility of mapping
    the spiral arms in the Galaxy.

- abstract: The second Gaia data release, Gaia DR2, encompasses astrometry, photometry,
    radial velocities, astrophysical parameters (stellar effective temperature, extinction,
    reddening, radius, and luminosity), and variability information plus astrometry
    and photometry for a sample of pre-selected bodies in the solar system. The data
    collected during the first 22 months of the nominal, five-year mission have been
    processed by the Gaia Data Processing and Analysis Consortium (DPAC), resulting
    into this second data release. A summary of the release properties is provided
    in Gaia Collaboration et al. (2018b). The overall scientific validation of the
    data is described in Arenou et al. (2018). Background information on the mission
    and the spacecraft can be found in Gaia Collaboration et al. (2016), with a more
    detailed presentation of the Radial Velocity Spectrometer (RVS) in Cropper et
    al. (2018). In addition, Gaia DR2 is accompanied by various, dedicated papers
    that describe the processing and validation of the various data products. Four
    more Gaia Collaboration papers present a glimpse of the scientific richness of
    the data. In addition to this set of refereed publications, this documentation
    provides a detailed, complete overview of the processing and validation of the
    Gaia DR2 data. Gaia data, from both Gaia DR1 and Gaia DR2, can be retrieved from
    the Gaia archive, which is accessible from https://archives.esac.esa.int/gaia.
    The archive also provides various tutorials on data access and data queries plus
    an integrated data model (i.e., description of the various fields in the data
    tables). In addition, Luri et al. (2018) provide concrete advice on how to deal
    with Gaia astrometry, with recommendations on how best to estimate distances from
    parallaxes. The Gaia archive features an enhanced visualisation service which
    can be used for quick initial explorations of the entire Gaia DR2 data set. Pre-computed
    cross matches between Gaia DR2 and a selected set of large surveys are provided.
    Gaia DR2 represents a major advance with respect to Gaia DR1 in terms of survey
    completeness, precision and accuracy, and the richness of the published data.
    Nevertheless, Gaia DR2 is still an early release based on a limited amount of
    input data, simplifications in the data processing, and imperfect calibrations.
    Many limitations hence exist which the user of Gaia DR2 should be aware of; they
    are described in Gaia Collaboration et al. (2018b).

- abstract: "First, we select SNRs from catalogs which overlap with HST fields in\
    \ M31 and M33. We limited our search to fields observed with the ACS and WFPC-2\
    \ instruments, as the optical CMDs tend to be deeper and offer the best SFH constraints.\
    \ For M31, we combine three SNR catalogs to select targets from: Braun &amp; Walterbos\
    \ (1993A&amp;AS...98..327B); Magnier et al. (1995, J/A+AS/114/215); Williams et\
    \ al. (1995BAAS...27..883W). All three catalogs make use of [S II]-to-H\u03B1\
    \ ratios to identify SNR. Our M33 SNR catalog comes from Long et al. (2010, J/ApJS/187/495),\
    \ who selected SNRs using both [S II]-to-H\u03B1 ratios and X-ray observations.\
    \ Long et al. (2010, J/ApJS/187/495) incorporated all previous SNR catalogs from\
    \ the literature in their analysis. As mentioned in Section 1, all new M31 data\
    \ analyzed in this work come from newly available PHAT data sets and therefore\

- abstract: "We present a probabilistic approach for inferring the parameters of the\
    \ present-day power-law stellar mass function (MF) of a resolved young star cluster.\
    \ This technique (1) fully exploits the information content of a given data set;\
    \ (2) can account for observational uncertainties in a straightforward way; (3)\
    \ assigns meaningful uncertainties to the inferred parameters; (4) avoids the\
    \ pitfalls associated with binning data; and (5) can be applied to virtually any\
    \ resolved young cluster, laying the groundwork for a systematic study of the\
    \ high-mass stellar MF (M&gt;~1M<SUB>\u022F</SUB>). Using simulated clusters and\
    \ Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling of the probability distribution functions,\
    \ we show that estimates of the MF slope, \u03B1, are unbiased and that the uncertainty,\
    \ \u0394\u03B1, depends primarily on the number of observed stars and on the range\
    \ of stellar masses they span, assuming that the uncertainties on individual masses\
    \ and the completeness are both well characterized. Using idealized mock data,\
    \ we compute the theoretical precision, i.e., lower limits, on \u03B1, and provide\
    \ an analytic approximation for \u0394\u03B1 as a function of the observed number\
    \ of stars and mass range. Comparison with literature studies shows that ~3/4\
    \ of quoted uncertainties are smaller than the theoretical lower limit. By correcting\
    \ these uncertainties to the theoretical lower limits, we find that the literature\
    \ studies yield &lt;\u03B1&gt;=2.46, with a 1\u03C3 dispersion of 0.35dex. The\
    \ precision on MF slope recovery in this paper are lower limits, as we do not\
    \ explicitly consider all possible sources of uncertainty, including dynamical\
    \ effects (e.g., mass segregation), unresolved binaries, and non-coeval populations.\

    \ catalogues for a galaxy in the local universe. The cluster properties were estimated\
    \ comparing the photometry (NUV and optical) with Single Stellar Population (SSP)\
    \ models. If the age distribution is approximated by a single power-law, we find\
    \ indices between -0.6 and 0 for the seven fields (independently of the binning\
    \ used), finding a systematic trend with the local environment. Additionally,\
    \ our results are inconsistent with the expected slope of \u223C1 from the MID\

- abstract: "The ongoing Gaia mission will undertake an astrometric, photometric and\
    \ spectroscopic survey of the Galaxy. The Gaia consortium will use Gaia-only data\
    \ to classify objects and to estimate their individual astrophysical parameters.\
    \ However, one can achieve more reliable estimates of stellar parameters by combining\
    \ Gaia data with data from other spectroscopic and photometric surveys. The Gaia\
    \ \"hybrid catalog\" project will provide an exquisite value-added catalogs of\
    \ astrophysical parameters for Gaia targets by taking into account the \"obvious\"\
    \ non-Gaia data (e.g., SDSS, WISE, Pan-STARRS, APOGEE, PPMXL, SDSS, 2MASS, Tycho).\
    \ By including spectroscopic indicators of metallicity when available, or infrared\
    \ photometry, we can reduce the degeneracies between extinction and temperature\
    \ and improve the estimation of metallicity and surface gravity. However, the\
    \ creation of such catalogs comes with significant challenges. First the cross-matching\
    \ of catalogs with various selection functions, or photometric depths. Second,\
    \ we must optimize the data analysis to produce the most accurate information\
    \ given a specific science goal. Finally, the construction of such catalogs will\
    \ require significant computation power. The current plan is to do this using\
    \ the local resources at the Max-Planck-Institut f\xFCr Astronomie, and then each\
    \ catalog will go through validation and integration processes to finally be released\
    \ as part of the value-added Gaia data products. From these challenges, it is\
    \ clear that hybrid catalogs will not be a copy of the Gaia catalog but must be\
    \ adapted to support very specific science questions. In the poster we presented,\
    \ we details in particular two applications of the Gaia hybrid catalogs. First,\
    \ we considered the addition of WISE data to the Gaia information. The WISE data\
    \ enable us to constrain not only the amount of extinction through the addition\
    \ of infrared data, but also allow us to better classify certain spectral types.\
    \ For instance, from the addition of the WISE filters, one can select the Oxygen-rich\
    \ Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGBs) stars to find spatial substructures with particular\
    \ interstellar medium properties. Breaking through the distance-extinction degeneracies\
    \ will also help finding large scale structures in the disk such as streams or\
    \ spiral arms, especially when combined with age or metallicity selections for\
    \ instance. Second, we presented one aspect of the hybrid catalogs dedicated to\
    \ support the analysis of star clusters. Star clusters are not only calibrators\
    \ of stellar evolution models but also references to study star formation in general.\
    \ We presented one future outcome of the hybrid catalogs, in which we provide\
    \ for known star clusters, an assessment of stellar memberships based on a combination\
    \ of phase-space, and colormagnitude distribution fitting. In this application,\
    \ the assumption that a cluster is a \"simple\" population provides a significant\
    \ advantage when deriving individual star properties. Eventually one can imagine\
    \ this application can be extended to stellar streams. Hybrid catalogs are meant\
    \ to be provided along with the Gaia data releases, and will offer a tremendous\
    \ source of validation for the Gaia Data Processing."

- abstract: The integrated properties of young star clusters are subject to large
    cluster-to-cluster variations because they depend directly on small numbers of
    bright stars. At ages at which red supergiants are expected to exist, these luminous
    but rare stars can be blamed for most of the variations. If unresolved clusters
    are to be used to constrain red supergiant models, methods must be developed that
    take these stochastic fluctuations into account. We discuss prospects and open
    issues in this field, based on recent work on high-mass clusters in M 82, and
    on first experiments towards a Bayesian study of cluster populations.

- abstract: The integrated spectro-photometric properties of star clusters are subject
    to large cluster-to-cluster variations. They are distributed in non-trivial ways
    around the average properties predicted by standard population synthesis models.
    This results from the stochastic mass distribution of the finite (small) number
    of luminous stars in each cluster, stars which may be either particularly blue
    or particularly red. The color distributions are broad and usually far from Gaussian,
    especially for young and intermediate age clusters, as found in interacting galaxies.
    When photometric measurements of clusters are used to estimate ages and masses
    in conjunction with standard models, biases are to be expected. We present a Bayesian
    approach that explicitly accounts for stochasticity when estimating ages and masses
    of star clusters that cannot be resolved into stars. Based on Monte-Carlo simulations,
    we are starting to explore the probability distributions of star cluster properties
    obtained given a set of multi-wavelength photometric data.

- abstract: Stellar evolution models are fundamental to nearly all studies in astrophysics.
    They are used to interpret spectral energy distributions of distant galaxies,
    to derive the star formation histories of nearby galaxies, and to understand fundamental
    parameters of exoplanets. Despite the success in using stellar evolution models,
    some important aspects of stellar evolution remain poorly constrained and their
    uncertainties rarely addressed. We present results using archival Hubble Space
    Telescope observations of 10 stellar clusters in the Magellanic Clouds to simultaneously
    constrain the values and uncertainties of the strength of core convective overshooting,
    metallicity, interstellar extinction, cluster distance, binary fraction, and age.

- abstract: We propose a panoramic imaging survey of M33 to extend the M31 PHAT survey
    to regions with 10x higher star formation intensity and markedly lower metallicity.
    Deep six-filter UV/optical/IR stellar photometry will provide (1) precision measurement
    of the high-mass IMF slope; (2) spatially-resolved maps of the recent star formation
    history (SFH) with ~5-10 Myr resolution; (3) maps of the cool, dusty ISM with
    25 pc resolution; (4) temperatures and luminosities for ~15 million stars; (5)
    maps of extinction law variations; and (6) ~1000 star clusters with well-measured
    ages and masses. We will combine these products with archival multi-wavelength
    data to elucidate the astrophysics of the interstellar medium (ISM). We will constrain
    the energetics of the ISM by linking the history of stellar energy input to the
    observed properties of the ISM; reconcile widely-used, but discrepant, dust emission
    models; disentangle the drivers that control dust composition; and measure lifetimes
    of molecular clouds. We will survey nearly all the molecular clouds and high extinction
    (A_V&gt;1) regions in M33, as well as regimes of star formation rate intensity,
    spiral arm strength, metallicity, and ISM pressure that are distinct from those
    in comparable surveys of M31 and the Magellanic Clouds. This survey adds M33 to
    the Milky Way, M31, and Magellanic Clouds as the fundamental calibrators of ISM
    physics, star-formation processes, and stellar evolution. The resulting data set
    will be comprehensive, highly versatile, and have tremendous legacy value. This
    program can only be accomplished with HST.

- abstract: The Red Clump (RC) and lesser-known early-AGB bump (AGBb) are recognizable
    features on the stellar color-magnitude diagram (CMD). The timescale of evolution
    along the red giant branch (RGB) and horizontal branch (HB) dictates the relative
    number of stars in each feature and the brightness at which they occur. Thus,
    they are sensitive to the various theoretical perscriptions employed by stellar
    evolution models for initial helium abundance, RGB mass loss, and convective overshooting.
    Previous work exploiting the utility of these features was done with Milky Way
    globular clusters; this work extends the investigation to an extragalactic environment
    using deep six-filter photometry from the PHAT survey in M31. We compare observed
    properties of the AGBb and RC with model predictions to empirically constrain
    input physics from the Padova stellar evolution models.PHAT is supported by HST
    GO-12055 administered by NASA.

- abstract: "Recent studies suggest that starburst dwarf galaxies played an important\
    \ role in the early universe. Because these galaxies dominate by number, their\
    \ leaked ionizing photons are likely main contributors to the reionization of\
    \ the intergalactic medium (IGM). However, the complex structure of the interstellar\
    \ medium (ISM) even at the pc scale makes it hard to predict the escape fraction\
    \ of ionizing photons from high-redshift galaxies accurately. Analogues to their\
    \ high-redshift counterparts, nearby starburst dwarf galaxies provide excellent\
    \ laboratories to study the impact of star formation on the surrounding ISM and\
    \ IGM in detail. Thanks to its proximity, the dwarf galaxy, NGC 4214, has been\
    \ imaged with the high-resolution of WFC3 on HST from the near-UV to the near-IR\
    \ (F225W, F336W, F438W, F814W, F110W, and F160W). These observations yielded measurements\
    \ of the broad spectral energy distributions (SEDs) for \u223C36,000 resolved\
    \ stars within this galaxy. We developed a probabilistic tool (Bayesian Extinction\
    \ and Stellar Tool, a.k.a. BEAST) to simultaneously infer from their SEDs the\
    \ stellar properties of individual stars and the intervening dust properties along\
    \ the line of sight to each star. With the aid of BEAST, we are able to infer\
    \ the intrinsic ionizing flux produced by individual stars. By comparing this\
    \ intrinsic ionizing flux with the flux that is used to ionize the ISM in the\
    \ galaxy, derived based on the extinction-corrected H\u03B1 emission, we can estimate\
    \ the escape fraction and its local variation within the galaxy. Our preliminary\
    \ results show that the global UV leakage of NGC 4214 is \u223C10%."

- abstract: There is currently a great divide between high resolution studies of stellar
    clusters and molecular clouds in the Milky Way, and those done in extragalactic
    systems, where individual stars and clouds cannot usually be resolved. For my
    thesis work, I combined several astronomical data sets to investigate the life
    cycle of molecular clouds in the Andromeda Galaxy. The primary data sets I used
    are the Panchromatic Hubble Andromeda Treasury (PHAT), which catalogued over 200
    million stars, and a molecular cloud catalogue that is constructed from new high
    spatial/spectral resolution (20 pc, 1 km/s) CARMA observations. Several ancillary
    data sets, including H-alpha and Spitzer IR emission maps were also used, taking
    advantage of broad wavelength coverage to search for indicators of star formation
    with different timescales. Comparisons were also made with the PHAT cluster sample,
    and the youngest (&lt;10 Myr) stellar clusters were used as an additional star
    formation indicator. The ages and masses of these clusters were determined by
    fitting the color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) of their resolved stars to theoretical
    isochrones. The distribution of the youngest clusters shows a strong correlation
    with the molecular cloud distribution, while no correlation is evident for clusters
    greater than 30 Myr. Each molecular cloud in the sample was then classified as
    a star-forming cloud or a non-star forming cloud, based on the presence of any
    one of several star formation indicators. About 60% of the clouds in the sample
    were found to be associated with massive star formation. Based on the comparison
    between these observations and the results from a Monte Carlo simulation, I will
    also demonstrate how we can constrain the timescales for the relative phases in
    a cloud's life.

- abstract: We present a new technique for mapping the distribution of dust in external
    galaxies. We use near-infrared stellar photometry to measure the distribution
    of reddening with ~20pc resolution in M31, using data from the Panchromatic Hubble
    Andromeda Treasury (PHAT). Specifically, we model the color-magnitude diagram
    of red giant branch stars as a combination of a narrow, unreddened foreground
    population and a background population that samples lines of sight through a log-normal
    distribution of extinction. We then fit the color-magnitude diagram to derive
    the median extinction, the dimensionless width of the log-normal, and the fraction
    of reddened stars, in 20pc bins. The maps show superb morphological agreement
    with other dust tracers (i.e., emission from dust and gas), but have a factor
    of &gt;4 times better resolution, while providing a more direct measurement of
    the dust column. The fits are less robust at very low extinctions, where they
    become sensitive to the exact structure of the unreddened red giant branch. We
    diagnose a significant calibration issue with widely-used dust models, which overpredict
    the observed extinction by a factor of ~2 when modeling the dust emission. Fixing
    this calibration error would significantly revise the dust budget in local galaxies.
    In contrast, our results agree well with extinctions predicted from the gas distribution,
    asssuming a standard Milky Way gas-to-dust ratio.

- abstract: In order to constrain basic dust physics and anchor the interpretation
    of both UV/optical extinction and IR emission at low and high redshifts, we propose
    seven-filter photometry of a key region in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). Via
    a cutting-edge technique demonstrated to work in M31 we will use these data to
    construct the first ever maps of the extinction curve shape (Rv), 2175 Angstrom
    bump strength, and dust column (Av) across a low metallicity environment. These
    maps will allow us to (1) measure the true distribution of extinction curves in
    the SMC, which is frequently used as a template for low metallicity extinction;
    (2) rigorously test whether PAHs are the carriers of the 2175 Angstrom extinction
    feature; and (3) place the estimation of dust masses from IR emission in low metallicity
    systems on a firm empirical and observational footing. Dust regulates the structure
    and evolution of interstellar medium (ISM) and shapes the optical and ultraviolet
    emission of galaxies. Its emission at infrared and mm wavelengths represents a
    powerful tool to probe the ISM out to the highest redshifts. Understanding the
    physics and interpretation of dust absorption and emission as a function of metallicity
    is critical to a vast range of science and mapping key dust properties is a new
    application, uniquely possible with UV through NIR imaging from HST. As such,
    we expect this program to have wide ranging scientific impact.

- abstract: Stellar evolution models are fundamental to all studies in astrophysics.
    These models are the foundations of the interpretation of colors and luminosities
    of stars necessary to address problems ranging from galaxy formation to determining
    the habitable zone of planets and interstellar medium properties. For decades
    the standard calibration of these models relied on a handful of star clusters.
    However, large uncertainties remain in the fundamental parameters underlying stellar
    evolution models. The project we propose is two-fold. First we propose to generate
    a new high quality reference dataset of the resolved stars in 121 Magellanic Cloud
    clusters, selected from 18 past programs to efficiently sample a large grid of
    stellar evolution models. Our team will measure the photometry of individual stars
    in those clusters and characterize individual completeness and photometric uncertainties.
    Second, we will migrate the calibration of the stellar evolution into a fully
    probabilistic framework, that will not only reflect the state-of-the-art, but
    will also be published with fully characterized uncertainties, based on the entire
    reference data set, rather than a few select clusters.We have entered an era dominated
    by large surveys {e.g. SDSS, PanSTARRS, Gaia, LSST} where the variations between
    families of stellar models are greater than the nominal precision of the instruments.
    Our proposed program will provide a library needed for a convergence in the stellar
    models and our understanding of stellar evolution.

- abstract: The PHAT survey is expected to find more than 2000 clusters in M31, creating
    one of the largest and most complete samples of clusters known in any galaxy.
    The six-filter PHAT imaging enables studies of clusters' integrated properties
    and their resolved stellar content. We detect clusters with masses as low as ~100
    Msun, orders of magnitude lower than previous extragalactic studies and ground-based
    studies of M31. We detail our efforts to identify and quantify the completeness
    of the PHAT cluster sample, and to determine cluster ages, masses and structural
    parameters. We present results using our initial cluster sample to understand
    the efficiency of star cluster formation, the cluster mass function, and the dissolution
    of clusters.

- abstract: I will present results from our ongoing study of the high mass stellar
    initial mass function (IMF) in M31. I will review the probabilistic technique
    for inferring the present day mass function (MF) of a resolved young star cluster
    that avoids many of challenges associated traditional IMF studies (e.g., binning
    of data, observational completeness), and show how this technique can robustly
    provide constraints on the high mass IMF. I will show preliminary MF measurements
    for select young clusters observed with PHAT, and discuss progress toward a secure
    high mass IMF determination in M31 using ~ 1000 young resolved star clusters.

- abstract: We study the relationship between the field star formation and cluster
    formation properties in a large sample of nearby dwarf galaxies. We use optical
    data from the Hubble Space Telescope and from ground-based telescopes to derive
    the ages and masses of the young (t_age &lt; 100 Myr) cluster sample. Our data
    provides the first constraints on two proposed relationships between the star
    formation rate of galaxies and the properties of their cluster systems in the
    low star formation rate regime. The data show broad agreement with these relationships,
    but significant galaxy-to-galaxy scatter exists. In part, this scatter can be
    accounted for by simulating the small number of clusters detected from stochastically
    sampling the cluster mass function. However, stochasticity does not fully account
    for the observed scatter in our data suggesting there may be true variations in
    the fraction of stars formed in clusters in dwarf galaxies. Comparison of the
    cluster formation and the brightest cluster in our sample of galaxies also provide
    constraints on cluster destruction models.

- abstract: The Panchromatic Hubble Andromeda Treasury (PHAT) is a multicycle Hubble
    Space Telescope (HST) program that has imaged nearly 1/3 of the star forming disk
    of M31 at high spatial resolution in 6 wavelengths ranging from the UV to the
    NIR. This high-quality data set allows for a detailed study of the galaxy's star
    clusters, ranging from massive 10^6 Msolar globular clusters to objects equivalent
    to Galactic open clusters with masses of &lt;10^3 Msolar. The Andromeda Project,
    one of the latest additions to the Zooniverse collection of citizen science projects,
    builds on the success of our Year 1 by-eye cluster search and enlists the public
    to help create one of the largest catalog of star clusters available for any galaxy.
    Using an interactive website, volunteers scour HST images to identify clusters,
    background galaxies, and image artifacts. By incorporating synthetic star clusters
    into the search, we will also obtain the first robust measurement of completeness
    for a by-eye cluster catalog. The detailed knowledge of catalog completeness is
    essential to assessing and interpreting age and mass distributions of Andromeda's
    cluster population. We present the website and compare our initial expert-derived
    approach with the use of citizen scientists.

- abstract: The Panchromatic Hubble Andromeda Treasury (PHAT) survey provides multi-wavelength
    coverage of nearly one-third of M31, including thousands of stellar clusters.
    The sensitivity of HST extends the cluster sample well into the low mass regime,
    where stochastic effects of luminous stars can significantly influence the observed
    integrated light, and must be properly considered when deriving cluster ages and
    masses. <P />We have applied a Bayesian analysis technique to account for variations
    in the integrated cluster light to derive the ages and masses of the 600 clusters
    from the Year 1 PHAT observations. Here we present the first results from our
    characterization of cluster properties, including a comparison with traditional
    methods of cluster age and mass determination. The large population of low mass
    clusters in the PHAT sample also provides for best constraints on the cluster
    mass function outside of the Magellanic Clouds.

- abstract: We describe a method for automatic detection of star clusters in M31,
    using the multi-band images taken with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) as part
    of the Panchromatic Hubble Andromeda Treasury (PHAT). Our method relies on the
    fact that at the distance of M31, images of star clusters observed with HST contain
    both a resolved stellar population and a significant amount of unresolved light.
    First, we use the point source photometry generated as part of the PHAT pipeline
    to subtract point sources from the images, leaving behind only the unresolved
    light, in addition to image artifacts. Next, we use the filtered, subtracted images
    to identify peaks in unresolved light. We compare these peaks to the point source
    photometric catalog to remove some of the contaminants and to identify likely
    candidate clusters. Finally, we employ neural network techniques to remove additional
    contaminants. Tests of the method show that we can automatically identify 85-90%
    of star clusters identified through by-eye searches, as well as find additional
    possible star clusters not found by eye. Implementation of this method will allow
    for the quantitative measurement of star cluster detection probability and completeness
    in the PHAT data, something which will be otherwise difficult to accomplish with
    by-eye searches.

- abstract: The high mass stellar initial mass function (IMF) underpins virtually
    all of extragalactic astrophysics. However, measurements of the IMF above a few
    solar masses exhibit significant dispersion, and recent evidence is suggestive
    of environmentally dependent IMF variations. The Panchromatic Hubble Andromeda
    Treasury (PHAT)program is a multi-wavelength survey including hundreds of resolved
    young clusters extending from the near-UV to near-IR, allowing for a systematic
    study of the high mass stellar IMF for a large set of clusters over a wide range
    of environments. <P />Here, we present a new Bayesian technique aimed at constraining
    the properties of the high mass IMF for resolved stars in individual clusters.
    This method probabilistically considers uncertainties in stellar mass, completeness,
    and cluster membership, and uses a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) to sample the
    posterior probability distribution. The MCMC analysis allows us to constrain both
    the slope of the IMF and the upper stellar mass limit for a single cluster, while
    fully exploring all associated uncertainties and degeneracies. We present simulations
    that explore the potential biases introduced by the number of observed stars,
    stellar mass uncertainties, completeness, aging effects and age spread, and binary
    stars. The application of this technique to the young cluster population in the
    PHAT survey will result in the one the most comprehensive investigations of the
    high mass stellar IMF to date. PHAT is supported by HST GO-12055 administered
    by NASA.

- abstract: 'Since the beginning of its mission in 2003, the Spitzer Space Telescope
    has spent two to three hours of every IRAC instrument campaign observing a particularly
    dark field located a few degrees from the north galactic pole: the IRAC Dark Calibration
    Field. The resulting survey is now the deepest integration from 3.5 to 8.0 microns.
    Its unique temporal depth (109 epochs over a span of 2000 days so far) provides
    a means of closely monitoring the variability of 15,000 stars and galaxies in
    the mid-infrared. We have photometered all 109 epochs in all four IRAC bands.
    Based on these 4x15,000 light-curves, we detected 30 IR-variable galaxies confirming
    previous observations (Hund et al., 2007) and 20 long-period variability stars
    (Fouesneau et al., 2009 in prep.). In this contribution, we review the multi-epoch
    analysis and related issues, especially the light-curve periodicity analysis.
    We present variable candidates, already confirmed by additional observations at
    other wavelengths. Finally, we discuss the outcomes and perspectives of such a
    deep survey.'

- abstract: We have analyzed IRAC imaging data from all 109 Spitzer visits to a very
    well-studied field, the IRAC Dark Calibration Field (IRAC-CF) near the north ecliptic
    pole. With this extensive dataset, we have already identified a unique sample
    of 30 IR-variable galaxies for which we are now working to characterize the variability
    amplitudes and timescales, panchromatic SEDs, and host morphologies, among other
    quantities. Unfortunately, the continual change in spacecraft roll angle means
    that our sources are typically observed for at most six months at a time by both
    IRAC FOVs in succession -- in other words, the visibility windows are exactly
    out of phase. Thus the planned Cycle 6 IRAC calibration observations, without
    the additional coverage our proposal would provide, will present large, unavoidable
    gaps that frustrate the time-delay analysis we wish to perform on exactly the
    timescales known to be typical of active galaxies. Since 2007 July, we have carried
    out cadenced IRAC observations in synchrony with the IRAC-CF dark-calibration
    observations as part of our approved Cycle 4 and 5 programs. We propose to continue
    this unique AGN monitoring campaign into 2010. The resulting timelines (covering
    2000 days thus far and expected to run ultimately to more than 2400 days), are
    a unique legacy of the Spitzer mission. This dataset, especially for the sizable
    unbiased AGN sample we now have, holds unique promise for measuring the colors
    and temperatures of IR-varying AGN, and will have much to say about the underlying
    physical models of the infrared AGN emission. Accordingly, we ask for just 8 h
    to gather IRAC photometry in the temporal gaps that would otherwise accrue in
    Cycle 6.
