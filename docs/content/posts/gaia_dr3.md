Finally, after many years of hard work, we made it! the [Gaia Data Release 3](https://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/gaia/data-release-3) (Gaia DR3) is out. GDR3 is the work of the [Gaia DPAC](https://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/gaia/dpac/consortium) (data processing and analysis consortium), i.e. over 400 European scientists and engineers.

### We overcame unforeseen complicated challenges

Gaia DR3 was marked by a very complicated context of unforeseen events and a pandemic context.
As a result, we decided to [split](https://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/gaia/news-2019#GaiaDR3Announcement) the release and the first part of GDR3 was published as EDR3 (early DR3) in December 2020.  This early release catalog contained information about **1.81 billion stars**: astrometry, and integrated broad band photometry.
This new part contains what the community has been waiting for eagerly: the dispersed light spectra (BP/RP) for 220 million objects, and 1 million high-resolution spectra (RVS).

### The CU8 data release: the astrophysical parameters

But the second part -- Gaia DR3 -- contains much more. It contains in particular the astrophysical paramters (APs), the work I took part in with the CU8 team. CU8 comprises more than 75 scientists and engineers across 15 cells and 8 countries and their work span a large variety of tasks: for instance software development, data management, refinement of stellar atmosphere, spectroscopy, and cosmology. In Gaia DR3, CU8 provides

* classifications for 1.6 billion sources,
* temperatures, gravities, distances, and radii for 470 million stars using BP/RP, and for 6 million using RVS,
* 130 million ages and masses,
* 5 million chemical abundances,
* 2 million chromospheric activity indices rotation velocities,
* and extinction maps.

The details, it is all described in the three main CU8 papers

* [Creevey et al. 2022](), an overview of the CU8 products and where to find them;
* [Fouesneau et al. 2022](), the performance summary on the stellar objects;
* [Delchambre et al. 2022](), the performance summary on the extragalactic sources and the Galactic interstellar medium.

This represents of course only a (not so) brief overview of the work that CU8 undertook.
**CU8 led 12 of the [45 papers](https://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/gaia/dr3-papers)** coming with Gaia DR3 and they had major contributions to a dozen more.


### What's next?

GDR3 spans 34 months of observations taken from July 2014 to May 2017.
The Gaia mission was initially planned for 5 years (until 2020) and Gaia has not stopped observing our Galaxy. We expect the mission to successfully pass the 10-year mark.

Gaia DR4 expected in ~2025 will contain all data products from the nominal 5-year mission:

* updated astrometry: parallax and proper motions
* all BP/RP and RVS spectra
* New astrophysical parameters (not only updated values)
* epoch astrometry
* epoch photometry
* and the raw data

And Gaia DR5 will mark the end of the mission with all 10-year+ data products.

### A human adventure through storms and bad weather conditions

Gaia DR3 was an adventure in many aspects. It was a long journey, but it is a very rewarding one.

I was a postdoc (until 2021) at the [MPIA](https://www.mpia-hd.mpg.de/) and I was part of the management team of CU8. I was leading the validation of the scientific products, but I also had technical responsibilities (e.g., data model, data management, software development).

It was far from smooth sailing. We went through a lot of storms and bad weather conditions. COVID-19 had a major impact on the timeline but most importantly on the mental health of the team. We had to deal with a lot of stress and we had to deal with a lot of work. But the team found the energy to adapt to the conditions and made it through for a successful release.

I learned a lot about managing a team and how to deal with my stress and the stress of others. I discovered why all this mindfulness thing is so important. I also realized aspects of academia that I had never seen before, and not all of them are healthy in my opinion.

I may write a retrospective on the human side of the journey.
