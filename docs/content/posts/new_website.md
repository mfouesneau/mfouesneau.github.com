Last November, I started my _tenure_ job (yay! ðŸ¥³) of data scientist at [MPIA](https://www.mpia.de/en/).
In this new role, I want to support scientists to carry out novel, cutting-edge research and to establish MPIA as a world-wide leader in astronomical data science.

* Solidify foundational hacking & coding skill.
* Provide a space to explore and develop data science skills.
* Networking, outside presence and broader impact
* Help the career development of my colleagues.

I felt that I should have a place to store and publish notes and ideas. I am therefore creating this new website which offers blog type publications.

I am very inspired by [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) in particular the [Academic](https://academic-demo.netlify.app/) template. However, my first impression is that the structure of the repository is cluttered, or too complex for my taste. Also I am not a bit fan of using a third party service to publish the website. By default you are guided to use [Netlify](netlify.com). I'm sure it is a very powerful platform, but I'm happy to remain simple and keep using GitHub.

This new website is a work in progress. My goals are to:

- Make a more modern and cleaner version of what I had before. (in particular update the js libraries ðŸ˜‰)
- Provide a space to share ideas and notes.
- Make a site that is super easy to maintain: compiling it from pure markdown! (and some python scripts)

My solution was to revamp my old content and adapt the
design using the template from [BootstrapMade](https://bootstrapmade.com/) - [MyResume](https://bootstrapmade.com/free-html-bootstrap-template-my-resume/)

Some realizations in this project:

- Markdown is so powerful for this game. You can add meta data to the files and use it to generate information.
- Why did I not use templating more before? ðŸ¤¦
- HTML/CSS flex is such a game changer in aranging web content. I am a fan of it.
