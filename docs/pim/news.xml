	This website has been created in order to officialy share worldwide pIM.
	I worked on multiple versions of this IDL program since
	october 2007. I tried first to create an application which allows me
	to moved over spectrum plots with zoom and move features. But things
	going on, I added features such as managing multiple curves, legends and
	so on. Finally it became a complete graphical application managing all I
	want in my Figures.::N::  
	This application is useful for creating complex figures under IDL
	with just a few commands.
	Thanks to my beta users and their comments, pIM has gained in design and
	functionalities such as managing multiple plots, multiple axis and also
	shared axis. Color system has also been improved so that any hexadecimal
	definition will be exactly exported to Postscript files.::N::
	::N::
	::I::Great Thanks to F. Renaud, aka &quot;Tonton&quot;, for all his help in order to
	create this not so &quot;simple&quot; website.::/I::
