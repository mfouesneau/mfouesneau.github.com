			The PHAT imaging was supplemented by an extensive
			spectroscopic campaign to derive kinematic properties of
			M31’s stellar populations.  Over 10,000 stars were
			observed with Keck’s DEIMOS spectrograph, yielding
			secure radial velocity measurements for close to 8,000
			stars.  The spectroscopic sample includes RGB stars of
			varying metallicity, AGB stars, blue and red
			supergiants, and main sequence stars.  Details can be
			found in Dorman et al 2013.

			The optical imaging from PHAT was used for an innovative
			“citizen science” campaign to identify stellar clusters.
			In partnership with the Zooniverse, users of the
			 <a href="http://www.andromedaproject.org"
				 target="_blank">“Andromeda Project”</a>
			inspected over 1.8 million images, identifying thousands
			of stellar cluster candidates.  These classifications
			led to a final catalog of over 2700 stellar clusters,
			spanning masses from 300 to a million solar masses, and
			ages from a few million to ten billion years old.
			Details can be found in Johnson et al 2014.<br />

			PHAT imaging offers an unprecedented high resolution
			(100pc) look at the stellar populations of a massive
			spiral. However, stars are only part of the baryonic
			census.  In an effort to match the resolution of PHAT,
			A. Leroy and A. Schruba have lead major programs to map
			M31 at extremely high resolution in the HI line (w/ the
			VLA) and in CO (w/ CARMA), as well as in the L-band
			radio continuum.  These surveys are revealing structures
			on the scale of individual molecular clouds.<br />

			To complement PHAT’s stellar census, K. Sandstrom led a
			Herschel PACS + Optical IFU line imaging survey of key
			diagnostic lines of the interstellar medium.  These
			lines provide measures of ISM cooling rates, which can
			be compared with the energy input from stellar sources,
