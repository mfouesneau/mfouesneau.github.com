            Last updated on 2022-06-13 &#183; 4min read &#183; <i class="fas fa-folder mr-1"></i> Gaia
          </p>
          <p>Finally, after many years of hard work, we made it! the <a href="https://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/gaia/data-release-3">Gaia Data Release 3</a> (Gaia DR3) is out. GDR3 is the work of the <a href="https://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/gaia/dpac/consortium">Gaia DPAC</a> (data processing and analysis consortium), i.e. over 400 European scientists and engineers.</p>
<h3>We overcame unforeseen complicated challenges</h3>
<p>Gaia DR3 was marked by a very complicated context of unforeseen events and a pandemic context.
As a result, we decided to <a href="https://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/gaia/news-2019#GaiaDR3Announcement">split</a> the release and the first part of GDR3 was published as EDR3 (early DR3) in December 2020.  This early release catalog contained information about <strong>1.81 billion stars</strong>: astrometry, and integrated broad band photometry.
This new part contains what the community has been waiting for eagerly: the dispersed light spectra (BP/RP) for 220 million objects, and 1 million high-resolution spectra (RVS).</p>
<h3>The CU8 data release: the astrophysical parameters</h3>
<p>But the second part -- Gaia DR3 -- contains much more. It contains in particular the astrophysical paramters (APs), the work I took part in with the CU8 team. CU8 comprises more than 75 scientists and engineers across 15 cells and 8 countries and their work span a large variety of tasks: for instance software development, data management, refinement of stellar atmosphere, spectroscopy, and cosmology. In Gaia DR3, CU8 provides</p>
<ul>
<li>classifications for 1.6 billion sources,</li>
<li>temperatures, gravities, distances, and radii for 470 million stars using BP/RP, and for 6 million using RVS,</li>
<li>130 million ages and masses,</li>
<li>5 million chemical abundances,</li>
<li>2 million chromospheric activity indices rotation velocities,</li>
<li>and extinction maps.</li>
</ul>
<p>The details, it is all described in the three main CU8 papers</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="">Creevey et al. 2022</a>, an overview of the CU8 products and where to find them;</li>
<li><a href="">Fouesneau et al. 2022</a>, the performance summary on the stellar objects;</li>
<li><a href="">Delchambre et al. 2022</a>, the performance summary on the extragalactic sources and the Galactic interstellar medium.</li>
</ul>
<p>This represents of course only a (not so) brief overview of the work that CU8 undertook.
<strong>CU8 led 12 of the <a href="https://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/gaia/dr3-papers">45 papers</a></strong> coming with Gaia DR3 and they had major contributions to a dozen more.</p>
<h3>What's next?</h3>
<p>GDR3 spans 34 months of observations taken from July 2014 to May 2017.
The Gaia mission was initially planned for 5 years (until 2020) and Gaia has not stopped observing our Galaxy. We expect the mission to successfully pass the 10-year mark.</p>
<p>Gaia DR4 expected in ~2025 will contain all data products from the nominal 5-year mission:</p>
<ul>
<li>updated astrometry: parallax and proper motions</li>
<li>all BP/RP and RVS spectra</li>
<li>New astrophysical parameters (not only updated values)</li>
<li>epoch astrometry</li>
<li>epoch photometry</li>
<li>and the raw data</li>
</ul>
<p>And Gaia DR5 will mark the end of the mission with all 10-year+ data products.</p>
<h3>A human adventure through storms and bad weather conditions</h3>
<p>Gaia DR3 was an adventure in many aspects. It was a long journey, but it is a very rewarding one.</p>
<p>I was a postdoc (until 2021) at the <a href="https://www.mpia-hd.mpg.de/">MPIA</a> and I was part of the management team of CU8. I was leading the validation of the scientific products, but I also had technical responsibilities (e.g., data model, data management, software development).</p>
<p>It was far from smooth sailing. We went through a lot of storms and bad weather conditions. COVID-19 had a major impact on the timeline but most importantly on the mental health of the team. We had to deal with a lot of stress and we had to deal with a lot of work. But the team found the energy to adapt to the conditions and made it through for a successful release.</p>
<p>I learned a lot about managing a team and how to deal with my stress and the stress of others. I discovered why all this mindfulness thing is so important. I also realized aspects of academia that I had never seen before, and not all of them are healthy in my opinion.</p>
<p>I may write a retrospective on the human side of the journey.</p>
